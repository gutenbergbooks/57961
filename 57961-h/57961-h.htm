<p class='c012'>The subject of prehistoric copper mining, together with
the trade in the metal and the process of its manufacture
into implements and tools by the red men of North America,
has engaged the attention of numerous investigators.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was while listening to an interesting paper on prehistoric
copper mining at Lake Superior, read by Prof. Thomas
Egleston before the Academy of Sciences, of New York,
March 9, 1879, that the writer was reminded of a number
of notes which he had made, some time previous, on the
same subject. These notes, however, covered a department
of research not included in the lecture of that evening.
They were collected in order to secure all the material
extant in relation to the copper products of Mexico and
Central America. Nevertheless, this treatment of a subject
so germain to ours, could not help imparting an impulse to a
rapid comparison of the results of our own studies with
those of others. It brought to light striking agreements,
as well as disagreements, which existed in connection
with the copper industries of the two widely separated
races. On the one hand it appeared that both of these
ancient people were unacquainted with iron; both were
trained to the practise of war, and, strange to say, both had
invariably abstained from shaping copper into any implement
of war, the metal being appropriated solely to the uses
of peace.</p>

<p class='c013'>But, on the other hand, whilst the northern red man attained
to his highest achievement in the production of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>axe, the native of Central America could boast of important
additions to his stock of tools. He possessed copper
implements for tilling the fields, and knew the uses of the
chisel. Besides, when he wished to impart to the copper a
definite form, he showed a superior ingenuity. The northern
Indian simply took a stone, and by physical force hammered
the metal into the required shape. But the skilled
workman of Tecoatega and Tezcuco, subjecting the native
copper to the heat of the furnace, cast the woodcutter’s axe
in a mould, as well as the bracelets and the fragile earrings
that adorned the princesses of Motezuma.</p>

<p class='c013'>Therefore, in view of the recently increasing interest
shown in archæological circles, respecting everything relating
to Mexico, the writer deemed it worth while to revise
the notes referred to.</p>

<p class='c013'>As to the fact that the early Mexicans used instruments
of copper, there can be no doubt. The brevity of the statements
respecting these instruments is nevertheless very perplexing.
The accounts of the Spanish chroniclers, indeed,
afford a certain degree of satisfaction, but they leave us
with a desire for fuller information. We should have felt
more grateful to these authorities if, out of the thousand
and more chapters devoted to the glorious deeds of the
“Castellanos and Predicadores,” they had written one in
which they had introduced us to the Mexican work-shop,
exhibiting the weaver, the paper-maker, the carpenter, the
goldsmith, and the sculptor, and initiating us into the
devices and methods respectively employed; describing the
form and shape of the tools they used, and giving an account
of all those little details which are indispensable for
achieving any technical or artistical results.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet, as it exists, the desired information is incomplete,
and, for the present at least, we can only deplore its brevity.
In looking for aid from other quarters we feel still more
perplexed. No specimen of any copper or bronze tool, apparently,
has been preserved, and we are thus prevented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>from determining whether the axes or chisels mentioned by
the Spanish authors were of the same shape as ours, or
whether the natives had contrived to give them a peculiar
shape of their own. Finally, no definite hint is given
whether the kind of copper metal, which they called “brass
or bronze,” was copper with the natural admixtures of gold,
silver, tin, or other tempering elements, or whether the
Mexicans had themselves discovered the devices of hardening,
and combined the elements in due conventional proportions.</p>

<p class='c013'>All these questions are of the highest interest, and claim
an answer. Our most renowned authorities for Mexican
archæology and history, Humboldt, Prescott and Brasseur
de Bourbourg,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a> pass over this subject without giving any
desired satisfaction. They do not go much farther than to
repeat the statements furnished by the writers in the
same language as they received them.</p>

<p class='c013'>These early statements will form the principal portion of
the material out of which we weave the text of our discussion.
In order that the reader may be better prepared to
enter into our reasoning and judge of the correctness of our
conclusions, we shall, in translation, place the statements
of these authors below the text, in the form of foot-notes;
though, in cases where it is believed that the reader may
desire to see the originals, the Spanish text is given.
Considerable help has been derived from a source hitherto
very little consulted, that of the native paintings, which
represent copper implements. As will be seen, they make
up, to a certain extent, for the deficiency of the latter in
collections. The cuts we give are of the same size as those
we find copied in the Kingsborough Collection.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>We shall speak first of those localities whence the natives
procured their copper and their tin; secondly, of the manner
in which they used to melt metals; thirdly, consider
whether the metal was moulded or hammered; and fourthly,
discuss the various forms into which their tools appear to
have been shaped.</p>

<p class='c013'>That the natives of the New World collected and worked
other metals besides gold and silver, seems to have become
known to the Spaniards only after their entrance into the
city of Mexico, A.D. 1521. During the first epoch, in
which the West India Islands and the Atlantic coasts of
South and Central America were explored and conquered,
no specimen of utensils, tools or weapons, made of brass or
copper, was discovered to be in the possession of the inhabitants.
So also in Yucatan, Tlascalla, and on the high
plateau of Anahuac, where mechanics and industry were
found to have a home, and where the native warrior
exhibited his person in the most gorgeous military attire,
their swords, javelins, lances and arrows, showed that concerning
the manufacture of arms they had, so to speak, not
yet emerged from the Stone-Age. And finally, when brass,
copper, tin, and even lead, were seen exposed for sale in the
stalls of the market-place of Mexico, it was noticed to the
great astonishment of the conquerors, that these metals
had exclusively served the natives for the manufacture of
mere instruments of peace.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Spanish leader communicates these facts to his
emperor in these few words:<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c014'><sup>[2]</sup></a>—“Besides all kind of merchandise,
I have seen for sale trinkets made of gold and
silver, of lead, bronze, copper and tin.” Almost the same
expressions are used in the memoirs of his companion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>Bernal Diaz de Castillo:<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c014'><sup>[3]</sup></a>—“And I saw <em>axes</em> of <em>bronze</em>, and
<em>copper</em>, and <em>tin</em>.” Under the influences of such a revelation
the hearts of the distressed Spaniards must have been elated
with joy and courage, when they saw not only a prospect of
replacing the arms which their small band had lost, but also
the source from which to equip the faithful Indian allies of
Tlascala in an efficient manner. Immediately after having
taken firm foothold on the conquered ground, Cortes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>ordered the goldsmiths of Tezcuco to cast eight thousand
arrow-heads of copper, and these weapons were made ready
for delivery within a single week.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c014'><sup>[4]</sup></a> At the same time, too,
the hope to have a supply of cannon made was presented to
the conqueror’s mind. The only question was from whence
to procure a sufficient quantity of the material necessary to
carry out this design.</p>

<p class='c013'>Copper is found to-day in nearly all the states of the
Mexican Republic. We abstain, therefore, from quoting the
localities. But as far as our information goes, no writer or
historian has stated where Cortes and before him the natives
themselves found it. To investigate this matter might be
of direct utility, at least. We intend to use a source
hitherto little explored, but which for the history of
Mexico is of greatest importance, the picture tables, called
the Codices Mexicana. These collections contain representations
of their historical, religious, social and commercial
life. The writer of this article has made himself familiar
with these sources, expecting to find in them disclosures
about the location of the ancient copper mines, as soon as
he could discover what <em>copper</em> was called in the language
of the natives. The answer comes in this connection.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Mexicans had the habit of giving a name to their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>towns and districts from the objects which were found in
abundance in their neighborhood. Therefore, copper regions
ought to bear a name which related to this mineral.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Lord Kingsborough’s Collection, Vol. V., pages 115–124,
there are two printed alphabetical indices of the names
of all the towns, whose hieroglyphic symbol, or, as we term
it, whose coat of arms, is represented in the Codex
Mendoza, to be found in Vol. I. of the same collection,
pages 1–72. This Codex is arranged in three sections. The
first shows the picture-annals of the ancient Aztec-Kings,
and the cities which they conquered (pages 1–17). The
second reproduces again the coats of arms of these cities,
but gives in addition the pictures of all the objects of
tribute which these cities had to pay. The third section
exhibits an illustration of how Mexican children were
trained from infancy up to their 15th year. Sections first
and second will claim our interest, exclusively.</p>

<p class='c013'>Copper, we learn from the Dictionary of Molina<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c014'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
was named in the language of the Nahoa speaking natives,
<i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">tepuzque</span></i>.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c014'><sup>[6]</sup></a> Upon searching in the above quoted Codices,
we find three names of towns which are compounds of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>word <i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">tepuzque</span></i>. Their names appear in the following form:
Tepoztla, Vol. I., page 8, fig. 2, and the same name on
page 26, fig. 13. Tepoztitla, page 42, fig. 10, and Tepozcolula,
page 43, fig. 3.</p>

<p class='c013'>The cuts 1, 2, 3 and 4, are faithful reproductions of the
coats of arms belonging to these towns.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>There cannot be any doubt as to the meaning of the
objects represented by these pictures. They mean axes.
Their handles appear in a curved form, the blades at their
cutting edges are somewhat rounded, and the tenons of
the blades are inserted below the top of the handles. Both
handles and blades are painted in a reddish brown color,
the wood as well as the copper.</p>

<p class='c013'>The differences between the pictured representations are the
following: Cuts 1, 2, and 4, show the axes growing out from
the top of a mountain, whilst the axe of cut <a href='#cut_3'>3</a> appears by
itself. Further, the axes of cuts 1 and 2, those of <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Tepoztla</span></i>,
show something applied to the handle, which in cut <a href='#cut_1'>1</a> we
recognize to be a single bow-knot, and in cut <a href='#cut_2'>2</a> the same
girdle with a bow-knot, yet wound about a dress of white
color, embroidered with red spots. A notable difference,
however, will still be noticed between the form of the axes
in cuts 1, 2, 3, and that in cut <a href='#cut_4'>4</a>, or <i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">Tepozcolula</span></i>. We shall
speak of this latter, on a later page, as an instrument very
closely related to the other axes.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>By means of these pictures we arrive at the knowledge of
the following facts: Copper was undoubtedly found in the
neighborhood of the three named cities. Moreover, copper
in these cities was wrought into axe-blades. Finally, the axe
will turn out to be the symbol used for copper, in general.</p>

<p class='c013'>Let us accept these facts and see whether this picture for
the symbol for copper does not return on other pages of
the same Codex, and thereby gain more information on the
subject. We notice the picture of the axe-blade reappearing
on the pages 39 and 42. Both happen to bear the
same number, that of figure 20, and both belong to the
same section of the Codex which contains the pictures of
the tributes paid by the conquered towns. Cut <a href='#cut_5'>5</a> is a
reproduction of fig. 20, page 39, Codex Mendoza. It shows
the metal axe without a handle hanging on a thread from
a line upon
which we
see five flags
are painted.
Moreover,
at the left
side is a little
picture.
A flag in
Mexican
symbol
writing signifies
the number twenty.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c014'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<div id='cut_5'  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Cut 5.</span><br /><br />Town of Chilapa.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>We may therefore conclude that by this combination one
hundred copper axes are indicated. The question now
arises, what city may have paid this tribute of copper axes?
The painter has not only omitted to connect directly these
flags and axe with one of the various coats of arms that are
grouped in their neighborhood, but even, if he had done so,
the student, still unacquainted with the art of explaining pictures,
would be unable to make out the name of the city,
embodied in the picture of the coat of arms. We will overcome
this difficulty by consulting the interpretation of the
Codex Mendoza, which is printed on the pages 39–89 of Vol.
V., Kingsb. Collection. There, on page 73, the suggestion
is given that the tribute objects refer to the town of
Chilapa, whose coat of arms (fig. 2), as we shall notice on
the cut, consists of a tub filled with water, and on whose
surface the <i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">chilli</span></i>-fruit appears, better known as the Spanish
red pepper <i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">chilli</span></i>, red pepper, <i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">atl</span></i>, water, <i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">pa</span></i>, in or above.
For this reason we learn that the town of <em>Chilapa</em> was
tributary in 100 axes.</p>

<div id='cut_6'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/cut_6.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Cut 6.</span><br /><br />Town of Chala.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In like manner we may proceed with the definition of the
picture found on page 42, fig. 20. The copy given in cut <a href='#cut_6'>6</a>,
shows 80 blades of copper
axes in fig. 20, and
besides 40 little copper
bells in fig. 19, and the
interpretation, Vol. V.,
page 76, informs us that
it was the town of Chala,
fig. 26, which had to pay
this kind of tribute.</p>

<p class='c013'>Therefore, the towns
of Tepoztla, Tepoztitla,
Tepozcolula, and, besides,
those of Chilapa and Xala,
must be considered to
have been connected, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>one way or the other, with copper mining, copper manufacture,
and the tribute of the same.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c014'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>A few words on the procuring of the metal from localities
where it was discovered by the natives, may find a suitable
place here. Mining, as we understand it to-day, or as the
Spaniards understood it already at the time of the conquest,
was not practised by the natives. Gold and silver were not
broken from the entrails of the rocks. They were collected
from the <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">placeres</span></i> by a process of mere washing. No notice
at all has come down to us how copper was gathered.
We can, however, easily imagine, that whenever by a
chance outcropping a copper vein or stratum became
visible, they probably broke off the ore or mineral to a
depth easy to be reached, and only selected the most solid
pieces. It is evident that the results of such superficial
mining must have been very trifling, certainly not greater
than would barely suffice for the fabrication of the most
necessary tools. Herein we will find an explanation, why this
people, though possessing the metal and the technical skill,
nevertheless did not use it for the manufacture of arms.
The production could not have been abundant enough to
supply the whole nation or even the professional soldier
with metal weapons. They preferred therefore, to continue
in the ignorance of the Stone-Age.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Where the Mexicans found the <em>lead</em> that was seen in the
market-place, nay, even the purposes for which they might
have used it, we have been entirely unable to learn. <em>Lead</em>
in the language of the Nahoas, is called <i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">temeztli</span></i> (<span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">telt</span> stone,
<span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">metzli</span> moon), moon stone, a name picturesque and characteristic,
as were most of those which stand in the list of
objects that belong to the realm of nature. Not a single
picture referring to lead can be found in the Mexican
Codices. The same must also be said of <em>tin</em>, the name of
which was <i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">amochictl</span></i>, a word seemingly Nahoatl in form,
but whose root was probably derived from a foreign language.
It will be gratifying, however, to learn from the pen
of the great conqueror Cortes himself, where the natives,
and afterwards his followers, found their <em>tin</em>. To quote the
language of Cortes,<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c014'><sup>[9]</sup></a> “I am without artillery and weapons,
though I have often sent money to obtain them. But as
nothing drives a man to expedients so much as distress, and
as I had already lost the hope that Your Royal Majesty
might be informed of this, I have mustered all my strength
to the utmost in order that I might not lose what I have
already obtained with so much danger and sacrifice of life.
I have therefore arranged to have men immediately sent
out in search of copper, and in order to obtain it without
delay I have expended a great amount of money. As soon
as I had brought together a sufficient quantity, I procured a
workman, who luckily was with us, to cast several cannons.
Two half-culverines are now ready, and we have succeeded
as far as their size would permit. The copper was indeed
all ready for use, but I had no <em>tin</em>. Without <em>tin</em> I could do
nothing, and it caused me a great deal of trouble to find a
sufficient quantity of it for these cannons, for some of our
men, who had tin plates or other vessels of that kind, were
not willing to part with them at any rate. For this reason
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>I have sent out people in all directions searching for tin,
and the Lord, who takes care of everything, willed graciously
that when our distress had reached its highest point,
I found among the natives of <em>Tachco</em><a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c014'><sup>[10]</sup></a> small pieces of tin,
very thin and in the form of coins.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c014'><sup>[11]</sup></a> Making further investigations
I found that this tin, there and in other provinces
was used for money, also that this tin was obtained from
the same province of <em>Tachco</em>, the latter being at a distance
of 26 leagues from this town. I also discovered the locality
itself of these mines. The Spaniards whom I despatched
with the necessary tools brought me <em>samples</em> of it, and I
then gave them orders that a sufficient quantity should be
procured, and, though it is a work of much labor, I shall
be supplied with the necessary quantity that I require.
While searching for tin, according to a report from those
skilled in the subject, a rich vein of iron-ore was also discovered.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now supplied with tin I can make the desired cannons,
and daily I try to increase the number, so that now I have
already five pieces ready, two half-culverines, two which are
still smaller, one field-piece and two <em>sacres</em>, the same that I
brought with me, and another half-culverine which I purchased
from the estate of the Adelantado Ponce de Leon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In the above report of Cortes, therefore, we are informed
of the name of the locality where tin was found and dug
by the natives. So we have the facts established that both
copper and tin<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c014'><sup>[12]</sup></a> were dug by the natives, that there was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>traffic, in them at that time, that Cortes himself succeeded
in getting at the mines from which they were extracted, and
that he had not been mistaken in his former recognition of
their display for sale in the public market.</p>

<p class='c013'>But before these ores could be shaped into the above
named commercial forms, it is clear that they still needed
to undergo a process of smelting. As to the peculiar mode
of smelting pursued by the natives, we have not been able
to find any distinct reference in the writings of the chroniclers.
It does not appear that the ancient Mexicans understood
the method of the Peruvians of melting their copper
in furnaces exposed to the wind on the lofty sierras, but we
may form for ourselves an idea of how they proceeded from
a picture in Codex Mendoza, page 71, fig. 24.</p>

<p class='c013'>Cut <a href='#cut_7'>7</a> gives a faithful
reproduction.</p>

<div id='cut_7'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/cut_7.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Cut 7.</span><br /><br />Smelting Gold.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In the midst of an
earthen tripod, surrounded
by smoke and
flames, we perceive a
small disk of a yellow
color. Our attention
is called to the peculiar
mark imprinted on the
surface of the disk.
Upon searching in Lord Kingsborough’s Collection, Vol. V.,
page 112, plate 71, where the interpretation of the little
picture is given, we learn, that the man sitting by the tripod,
is meant to be a goldsmith. Hence we conclude the disk
must be understood to mean a round piece of gold, and that
very probably the mark printed on it, was the usual symbolical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>sign for gold.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c014'><sup>[13]</sup></a> At the right of the tripod sits a man
wrapped in his mantle, no doubt the master of the work-shop;
for the addition of a flake flying from his mouth, as
the typical sign for language or command, gives us a right
to suppose that we have before us the so-called <i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">temachtiani</span></i>,
or master of the trade. At the left side crouches
the apprentice, <i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">tlamachtilli</span></i>. He holds in his right hand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>a staff, one end of which is in his mouth and the other
is placed in the crucible. <i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">Tlapitzqui</span></i>, in the Nahoatl language
means at the same time a flute player and a melter of
metal. This etymological version therefore conveys the
idea, that the staff held by the smelter signifies a pipe or
tube used for increasing heat by blowing the fire, as the
staff is similar to a long pipe or flute and is held in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>mouth of the workman.  In his left hand he holds a similar
staff, but there is no means of recognizing whether it is a
stick for stirring the embers, or a tube to be used alternately
with the other.  Now, we shall be permitted to draw
a conclusion from this process of smelting gold as to the
manner of smelting copper.  The process must have been
exactly the same with both.  For, if the Mexican goldsmith,
with the aid of a blowpipe, was able to increase the heat of
the fire to such a degree as to make gold fusible, a heat
which requires 1,100° C., he cannot have found greater
difficulties in melting copper, which requires nearly the same
degree of heat; and tin, which is far more easily fusible,
could have been treated in the same way.</p>

<p class='c013'>Melting was followed by casting into forms or moulds,
and these moulds must have been of stone.  This might
be concluded from the language of Torquemada and
Gomara.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c014'><sup>[14]</sup></a>  The words “<em>by placing one stone above another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>one</em>” are too clear to leave the least doubt as to what
the author meant. This process will account for the absolute
identity we had the opportunity to observe existing
between certain trinkets of the same class, coming chiefly
from Nicaragua and Chiriqui. No specimens of a mould,
however, have come to our view, or have been heard of as
existing in any collection, probably because whenever they
were met by the “<i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">huaqueros</span></i>,” they did not recognize them
as such, and threw them away.</p>

<p class='c013'>The scanty knowledge we have of all these interesting
technical details will not be wondered at, if we consider
that we derive it from no other class of writers than from
unlearned soldiers, and monks unskilled in the practical
matters of this world. But still, the principal reason for
this want of information is that the Mexican artist was as
jealous in keeping his devices secret, as the European.
They also formed guilds, into which the apprentices were
sworn, and their tongues were bound by fear as well as
interest. Let us quote only one instance. The Vice-King
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Mendoza reports to the Emperor<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c014'><sup>[15]</sup></a> that he offered to pardon
one of those workmen, if he would disclose how he was
able to counterfeit the Spanish coins in so striking a way.
But the native preferred to remain silent and was put to
death.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here is the place for asking the question: Would not the
early Mexicans, aside from their practice of casting the above
metals, have employed also that of hammering? Our reply
would be emphatically in the negative, if taking the expression
“hammering” in its strict meaning, which is that of working
with the hammer. The writers of the Conquest have
left the most explicit testimony, that the natives, only after
the arrival of the Spaniards became acquainted with this
instrument, and with the art of using it for working high
reliefs out of a metal sheet. Moreover, the native vocabulary
has no word for the metal hammer as it is commonly
understood. Yet the wooden mallet was known, the so-called
<i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">quauhololli</span></i>, and used by the sculptors. In the gradual
education of mankind in technical knowledge, beating of
metals, of course, must have preceded casting. The ancestors
of the early Mexicans, at a certain epoch, stood
on the same low stage of workmanship as their more
distant northern brethren. But when the inventor of the
mould had taught them how to multiply the objects most
in demand, by the means of this easy, rapid and almost infallible
operation, we must not imagine that he had done away
entirely with the old practice of beating and stretching
metal with a stone. The practice, in certain cases,
would have been maintained: as for instance, when a
diadem, a shield, or a breastplate was to be shaped, and on
occasions when the object to be made required the use of
a thin flat sheet of metal. Such objects are not only described
by the writers, but are also represented by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>native painters. A specimen of such a kind is mentioned,
which on account of its extraordinary beauty, workmanship
and value left a deep impression on the conquerors. It was
the present which Motezuma made to Cortes at his landing,
on the <em>Culhua</em> coast, “the two gold and silver wheels;” the
one, as they said, representing the Sun, the other the Moon.
According to the measures they took of them, these round
discs must have had a diameter of more than five feet. It
is preposterous to imagine that round sheets of this size
should have been the product of casting.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c014'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>We pass on now to discuss the various tools which we
have reason to think were cast in copper or in bronze, by
the early Mexicans.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <em>axe</em> stands in the first place. Cortes, we shall remember,
omitted to specify any of the objects which he
saw exposed for sale in the market-place. Not so his companion,
Bernal Diaz. He, after a lapse of 40 years, when
occupied with the writing of his memoirs, has no recollection
of other tools, which he undoubtedly must have seen,
except the much admired bronze axes. Specimens of these
were sent over to Spain in the same vessel on which the
above mentioned presents to the Emperor were shipped.
At their arrival at Palos, Petrus Martyr of the Council
House of the Indies was one of the first to examine the
curiosities sent from the New World, and to gather from the
lips of the bearers their verbal comments. His remarks
on the axes he had seen, are “with their bronze axes and
hatchets, cunningly tempered, they (the Indians) fell the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>trees.” There are three expressions in this passage which
will claim our attention. First, we learn that two classes
of axes were sent over, one of which Martyr recognized
as a “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">secūris</span></i>” the other as a “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dolabra</span></i>” hence a common
axe, and another which was like a pick or a hoe. Further on
we shall give an illustration of these axes, taken from the
pictures of the natives, when we are to recur again to this
subject. Our author, in the second place, describes the two
axes as of bronze, for this is the English rendering of
the Latin expression: <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">aurichalcea</span></i>. Thirdly, we learn, that
the blades were “cunningly tempered” or “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">argute temperata</span></i>.”
This language requires explanation.</p>

<p class='c013'>The attentive reader will remember what has been said
respecting Cortes and Bernal Diaz, whether they recognized
the bronze objects in the market as a mixture of copper
and tin, of themselves, or whether they had been inquisitive
enough to ask for information, and in consequence learned
that it was a common practice among the workmen to mix
these two metals, in certain proportions, in order to
produce a harder quality of copper. The latter hypothesis
seems to gain a certain corroboration from Martyr’s language.
For there cannot be the slightest doubt as to what
he meant when putting down the words “cunningly tempered.”
He wished to express the idea, that he had positive
grounds for the conviction, that the metal of which the
axes were made, was not a <em>natural</em> but an <em>artificial</em> product.
What grounds for this conviction he had, he does not,
however, communicate to his reader.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our author has the well deserved reputation of being one
of the fullest authorities for all that concerns the discovery
and conquest of the western hemisphere. Of all, however,
that he has written, the pages containing the landing of
Cortes in Yucatan, and the entrance of the Spaniards in
the capital of Motezuma, appear to have been the most
attractive to the general reader and the student; these pages
being torn and soiled in the existing copies of his original
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Latin, as well as of its translation into foreign languages.
We mention this circumstance, for it is not without a certain
bearing upon our question. It proves how confidently the
reading public has drawn upon the author’s statement, and
how eagerly students have sought to digest his amazing
accounts, quite unsuspicious, however, of the errors in dates
as well as facts; admiring rather than criticizing the pompous
phraseology of his mediæval Latin, or his often very suggestive
but somewhat flighty speculations. In Petrus Martyr,
therefore, we may recognize the originator of the widespread
theory that the Mexicans possessed the secret of
manufacturing bronze in the highest perfection and in
accordance with metallurgical rules. We are, however,
forewarned. The statement is of importance, and must be
weighed before accepting it. We fear it will fail like many
genial but unsupported inspirations, of which our author
was susceptible. If we ask whence he derived the notion
that the bronze tools were “argute temperata” we shall
find that he failed to give any authority. Petrus Martyr,
whom we often find quoting the full names and special
circumstances by the aid of which he gathered the material
for his historical letters, does not follow this laudable practice
on this occasion, even though the matter was one of importance
to investigators like himself. For these instruments
of bronze, and many other tools sent over, must have been,
in another way, still more interesting to him than the
objects of industry themselves. These tools afforded the
most palpable proof of an independent industry practised
by that strange people beyond the sea; they were a key
perhaps also to the riddle, how it was possible to perform
those marvels of workmanship. This silence of Petrus
Martyr respecting the details of the “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">argutia</span></i>” which he
professes that the natives employed in manufacturing their
bronze is so much the more striking, since we find him
enlarging a long while upon their manufacture of paper;
and he shows himself correctly informed respecting that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>process. It is clear that the one was as well worth detailing
as the other. Therefore we cannot help expressing the suspicion,
that whilst he had correct information respecting the
one, he had none respecting the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>It would, however, be venturing too much to reject so
important a statement merely on the grounds alleged. In
order to save it, we could fairly say, that he omitted his
references through carelessness. Accepting this position,
let us then seek to ascertain, who his informants might have
been, and chiefly inquire what they were able to tell him
about the manufacture of bronze in Mexico.</p>

<p class='c013'>The circumstances accompanying the arrival of the precious
gifts from the capital at the Camp of Cortes, their
shipping and unlading at Palos, and their registration at
the custom-house, are perfectly known. From them we
gather the following points: First, no Spaniard had yet set
foot in the interior, they were still loitering on the shores
of Vera Cruz, where the embassies of Motezuma made
their appearance. Hence, they were still shut off from
the opportunity of inspecting the workshops of Tezcuco,
Mexico and Azcapotzalco, the centres from which this special
class of merchandise was spread over the whole isthmus.
Cortes, who had many reasons for hastening the transfer of
the precious treasures to the ships, without much delay
despatched one of them, intrusting two of his friends,
Montejo and Puerto Carrero, with the mission of presenting
to the Emperor the report of his startling discoveries
and the presents coming from the new vassal-king. Petrus
Martyr, indeed, mentions these two cavaliers, as being Cortes’
messengers, and it is highly probable that it was from their
lips that he gathered among other correct information also
that about the manufacture of paper. The special kind of
paper he describes, is one which was manufactured and
used exclusively on the coast of Yucatan and Vera Cruz,
not the paper of the maguey-plant which grows on the
high plateaus, but that of the amatl-tree, a native of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">tierra caliente</span>. Being in the very country where this
kind of paper was manufactured, the Spanish writers, therefore,
had the opportunity of hearing how paper was made,
even, possibly, of seeing the process itself, which they had
not enjoyed in the case of bronze. Could they have got the
information from the mouths of the embassadors? We
know they held shyly aloof. The intercourse was very ceremonious,
and difficult besides, since the conversation passed
through the two native languages, and we cannot fairly
imagine that the technical question of manufacturing bronze
should have become one of the topics of inquiry. Moreover,
we do not believe that special attention would have
been paid to these bronze implements, if we consider the
overpowering impression which the richness and rareness of
the other objects must have caused them. Finally, would
they not have believed the yellow metal to be gold? since
they dreamt of nothing else, and were far from imagining
that the opulent ruler of Mexico would have made their
Emperor a present of poor bronze tools.</p>

<p class='c013'>We are not able to offer any conclusive evidence against
the remarkable statement made by Petrus Martyr. We are
fully aware how many positive proofs are required to
render it totally invalid. But we deemed it to be our duty
not to withhold from our readers the many grave doubts we
entertain against its too ready acceptance. We have still to
add, that this statement stands isolated and without support
in the whole literature of the Conquest. His contemporary
writers, indeed, occasionally speak of copper axes that were
tempered by an alloy. None of them, however, goes so far
as he, to impute to the early Mexicans the preparation of
an artificial bronze, as was so manifestly implied by the
words, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">argute temperatis</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The passages which speak about the axes used by the natives
are cited below<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c014'><sup>[17]</sup></a>. Three kinds are mentioned, stone,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>copper and bronze axes. The first of them must have been
in use among such tribes as lived outside of the circle of
Mexican trade and civilization, or among those which intentionally
held themselves aloof. For its retention and use
the complete absence of ores in certain districts may have
had a decided influence, as for instance was the case with
the peninsula of Yucatan.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c014'><sup>[18]</sup></a> The shape of the Yucatecan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>blades and that of the handle and the adjustment of both,
at least as far as is shown (see cut <a href='#cut_8'>8</a>) by the pictures of the
Dresden Codex, which are of genuine Yucatecan origin,
appear to have been identical with those of the interior of
Anahuac.</p>

<div id='cut_8'  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Cut 8.</span><br /><br />Axes of Yucatan.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Among the copper and bronze axes noted below, those
of Nicaragua appear to have been of an uncommonly rich
alloy of gold. The reader will smile at Herrera’s account
of the shrewdness shown by the native ladies in keeping for
themselves the plates of pure gold they were attired with,
and burdening the soldiers of Gonzales with heavy metal
axes.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c014'><sup>[19]</sup></a> The axes mentioned by Gomara, undoubtedly came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>from the mines of Anahuac, since their alloy was not only
gold, but tin and silver. Gomara is the first who notes
the chisel and the borer.</p>

<p class='c013'>Let us further ascertain, what Father Sahagun<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c014'><sup>[20]</sup></a> is able to
tell us about Mexican metal tools. As a teacher of the young
native generation, he made it his life’s task to teach his
pupils all that concerned the religious belief, the history and
the industry of their forefathers. We extract from Lib. 10,
Cap. 7, the following passages and translate them as literally
as possible: “The goldsmith is an expert in the selection
of good metal. He knows how to make of it whatever he
likes and does it with skill and elegance. He is conversant
with all kinds of devices, and all this he does with composure
and accuracy. (<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Con medida y compas</span></i>). He knows how to
purify the ore, and makes plates of silver as well as of gold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>from the cast metal. He knows likewise how to make
moulds of carbon (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">moldes de carbon</span></i>), and how to put the
metal into the fire in order to smelt it. The unskilful goldsmith
does not know how to purify the silver, he leaves it
mixed up with the ashes, and has his sly ways in taking and
stealing something of the silver.” Further on in Cap. 24:
“he who is a trader in needles (<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">agujas</span></i>), casts, cleans, and,
polishes them well; he makes also bells (<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">cascabeles</span></i>), filters
(<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">aguijillos</span></i>), punches (<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">punzones</span></i>), nails (<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">clavos</span></i>), axes (<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">hachas</span></i>),
hatchets (<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">destrales</span></i>), cooper’s adzes (<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">azuelas</span></i>), and chisels
(<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">escoplos</span></i>).”</p>

<p class='c013'>In these two passages is summed up all that we sought
to gather piecewise from the writers of the Conquest, on
our special question. A few new features, however, are
cropping out in this enumeration of implements, which give
rise to the suspicion, that the goldsmith is described, not as
he worked before the year 1521, but as he had perfected
himself and enlarged his technical knowledge through the
intervention of Spanish mechanics, in the year of Sahagun’s
writing, about 1550. We mean the moulds of carbon, the
nails,<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c014'><sup>[21]</sup></a> and the cooper’s adze, of which we read in Sahagun
exclusively, and of which no pictures or other evidences of
their ante-Spanish existence have been preserved.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pictures of needles frequently occur in the Mexican
paintings. But it is understood that they are without an
eye, the introduction of our sewing needle having been an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>actual revelation to the natives. The head of a Mexican
needle, or rather pin, was full, and split like that of an
animal’s bone. The borer, certainly, had no handle or spiral
point. Of all these stitching, piercing and drilling instruments
nothing has been preserved, in kind.</p>

<div id='cut_9'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/cut_9.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Cut 9.</span><br /><br />Copper Chisel found in Oaxaca.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>A chisel of copper was, however, discovered by Captain
Dupaix<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c014'><sup>[22]</sup></a> near the city of Antequera (in Oaxaca). We give
a faithful fac-simile of it in cut <a href='#cut_9'>9</a>. It is described by the discoverer
in the following words: “There are also many chisels
of red copper found in the neighborhood of this city, a specimen
of which I possess, and will show in the illustrations.
Its length is seven inches, and the thickness is one square
inch (<i>sic</i>), and one side is edged, and this edge is a little
dull, showing that it had been in use. We do not know the
temper they gave to these instruments in order to employ
them in their labors and in their arts, or to give the wood
or possibly the stone a regular form.”</p>

<p class='c013'>We do not know if this chisel is still preserved in the
Museum of Mexico, to which it was presented by Captain
Dupaix. If not, we hope to be somewhat indemnified by
another specimen of bronze chisel, of which we are now in
pursuit, and which according to description is similar in
form and composition to the one spoken of. Señor Andrez
Aznar Perez, now in New York, ploughed up such a tool
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>about twelve years ago, on his plantation near the river
Tzompan in Tabasco, at the depth of nearly 12 inches.
It was entirely solid, and had a slightly rounded edge, about
an inch in length, and he offers to have it brought from
Yucatan for further examination.</p>

<p class='c013'>From the illustration of Captain Dupaix and the description
of Mr. Perez, we can for the moment only conclude
that the ancient Mexican chisel was similar in its form to
that which our stone-masons now make use of.</p>

<p class='c013'>In regard to the form of ancient Mexican axes, we gave
a general idea at the beginning of this essay, but we have
still several details to discuss. In the illustrations the
curved wooden handle will no doubt appear remarkable.
The Mexican painters were such faithful imitators of what
they saw, that we cannot presume they would have indulged
in what was an essential alteration of the object to be copied.
If the handle of the axe was curved, they would have
copied it curved, and thus it appears not only in the Mexican
but also in the Yucatecan picture codices.</p>

<p class='c013'>Those acquainted with the practical handling of axes, and
with felling trees, know that a curved handle must increase
the swinging power of an axe to a considerable degree, and
to have used this form is a remarkable instance of Mexican
technical craft and cunning. It would be worth while to
investigate whether this use of a curved handle was exclusively
confined to the natives of Central America, or had
passed beyond its boundaries, north as well as south.</p>

<p class='c013'>We further learn from the pictures, that not the blade of
the axe, but the handle had an opening at a certain distance
from the top, into which the blade was fitted.</p>

<p class='c013'>The specimens represented in the cuts 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, appear
to be common chopping axes. In the coat of arms of the
town of Tepozcolula (see cut <a href='#cut_4'>4</a>), however, as already
pointed out, the form of the axe differs from those of
Tepoztla and Tepoztitlan. In order to obtain a correct idea
of these particular kinds of axes, we invite the reader to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>compare it with another picture (Cod. Mendoza, page 71,
fig. 77), and which we give in cut <a href='#cut_10'>10</a>. The shape of the
axes themselves are evidently alike, in
the one as well as in the other picture,
only that in cut <a href='#cut_10'>10</a> the axe is not in
connection with the coat of arms, but
is held by a man who is at work dropping
or squaring the branch of a tree,
from which chips are flying off. This
kind of axe, evidently, served a different
purpose from those chopping
axes of Tepoztla. It was the hatchet
used by the carpenter. Thus reads the
explanation given in Kingsb. Coll., Vol. V., page 112.</p>

<div id='cut_10'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/cut_10.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Cut 10.</span><br /><br />Mexican carpenter.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>This instrument is of the most extravagant form. Were
it not for the authentic interpretation of the picture and
the accessories we should not be able to make out what kind
of object it represented, and least of all that it was a
hatchet.</p>

<p class='c013'>Let us examine its construction. The wooden handle has
the shape of all the Mexican and Yucatecan axes,—that of a
somewhat curved club. But instead of its being chopped
off at the top, the handle extends farther and is bent down
to an angle of about 45 degrees. On the head of this
bent top a deep notch is visible, into which the blade of a
little axe is fixed, being fastened by a tongue or string
wound three times around. Thus, when a blow was struck,
we can presume, the head of the tenon would not move,
from the resistance it met from the bottom of the notch.
Thus much the picture proves, and we cannot learn anything
more of this instrument. We only presume that in
order to get a durable handle, they sought a curved branch,
and that this branch came generally from one particular
class of trees. The word <i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">Tepozcolula</span></i> signifies, properly,
the town in which copper was bent, <i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">tepuzque</span></i> (copper), and
<span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">coloa</span> (to bend), but we learn from our picture, that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>natives understood these words to signify the town where
the curved handles were manufactured, which seems to be
corroborated by another picture which we found for the
coat of arms of the town of Tepozcolula, Cod.
Mendoza, pl. 45, fig. 5, in which the painter
(see cut <a href='#cut_11'>11</a>) has laid a special stress upon this
curving of the <em>handle</em>, by shaping the end of
the handle into an exaggerated spiral form.</p>

<div id='cut_11'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/cut_11.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Cut 11.</span><br /><br />Tepozcolula.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There existed also a town, in which carpenter’s
work was the chief occupation of the
inhabitants. This is to be inferred from the
coat of arms belonging to the town of
Tlaximaloyan, cut <a href='#cut_12'>12</a>, Cod. Mendoza, pl. 10, fig. 5.</p>

<p class='c013'><i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">Tlaxima</span></i> signifies to work as a carpenter, and <i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">tlaximalli</span></i>
a chip of wood. The
“<em>little</em>” axe of copper, found
by Dupaix at Quilapa, and of
which he gives an illustration
not differing from the known
shapes of all axes, is very probably
a specimen of this carpenter’s
axe (see Dupaix, Vol.
II., 3d Expedition, Planche
II., fig. 4).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It is but natural to think that being in possession of the
large chopping axe, the invention of the small hatchet would
have become incomparably easier than that of this awkward
carpenter’s tool. We are, however, too little informed to
judge or to criticize its construction and rather incline to
think that these people had reasons of their own for giving
it the form it has. It must have been the one which Sahagun
called “<span lang="ca" xml:lang="ca">destral</span>,” or carpenter’s hatchet.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c014'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>We can still offer another form of copper tool once used
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>by the natives. Dupaix<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c014'><sup>[24]</sup></a> discovered the original near the
same town where he had found the chisel. Below is a copy
of his drawing in cut <a href='#cut_13'>13</a>:</p>

<div id='cut_13'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/cut_13.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Cut 13.</span><br /><br />Copper Tool, found by Dupaix in Oaxaca.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The edge of this tool will be noticed to have a curve belonging
to the circumference of a circle. The cutting blade
is 10 inches wide. Like the axes, it has a tenon by which it
could be fastened to an opening in a wooden handle. It will
appear from closer description that it was too thin to have
been used for heavy operations. Let us consult the narration
of the explorer: “This instrument is of red and very pure
copper, and when touched it gives out a sonorous sound.
The metal is <em>not hammered</em> but <em>cast</em>. It is of not much
weight, symmetrical, and of graceful shape. The contours
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>are regular and resemble those of an anchor. It is flat on
both sides, the portion serving as a handle (or tenon) is a
little thicker and slopes towards the edge, which cuts as well
as a chisel. An Indian, named Pascual Baltolano, from the
village of Zocho Xocotlan, half a mile distant from this city
of Antequera, a few months ago, when tilling his field met
with an earthen pot which contained 23 dozen of these
blades, their quality, thickness and size being a little different
from each other. This gives rise to the supposition that there
existed various moulds, by means of which these specimens
were multiplied and cast. They did not differ greatly from
that which I possess. We meet here with a great difficulty,
which is to determine to what usage these instruments were
destined,—to agriculture or mechanics, as instruments of
sacrifice or a variety of offensive weapon that was fixed in
the point of a lance? That which is certain, however, is that
they are found in abundance in this province and that merchants
buy these metals from the Indians and rank them
high on account of the superior quality of the ore.” On
proceeding in his expedition, the same author reaches the
village of Mitla, where in the parochial church he receives
the following disclosure on the purpose of the before-mentioned
tools: “One day, when hearing mass in Mitla, I noticed
an ancient picture, which represented (San.) Isidro, the
patron of the laborers, and saw him painted holding in his
right hand a pole armed with the problematic blade. I therefrom
conclude, that like the ancient Indians, the native laborers
of to-day have adopted this instrument as a distinctive
mark of their profession, and that instead of being an
instrument of death it must be viewed as one for giving life.”
This explanation agrees satisfactorily with what could be inferred
from its size and its peculiar shape, and if we imagine
the tenon bent and in this form fastened to the top of a pole
we should possibly have discovered a certain garden instrument
of which the Spaniards spoke as always used by the
natives, the <i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">uictli</span></i>, or coa, hoe. It was never described in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>particular, nor could we discover it in the pictures, but Molina’s
translation of <i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">uictli</span></i> with “<i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">coa</span></i>” which is hoe, tells the
story.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is still something more in this passage of Dupaix,
that is worth considering. Among the 23 dozen of the
instruments contained in the earthen pot, and of which he
was informed that they were similar in shape to that which he
had found, it is clear that there must have been a great number
of very diminutive size; otherwise we cannot conceive how so
many of them would have been placed in the pot, at all. Let
us take advantage of this suggestion and suppose Dupaix’s
engraving, cut <a href='#cut_13'>13</a>, reduced to a diminutive size. We make
thereby a little figure, and we cannot deny that it looks like
a Greek <em>Tau</em>. Of such a <em>Greek Tau</em>, formed from copper,
and used by the natives as money at the time of the Conquest
mention is made by the chroniclers.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c014'><sup>[25]</sup></a> They may be
right, but with the understanding that these copper pieces
were not manufactured for the purpose of serving as coin,
but as tools, which of course, came into market and became
objects of barter, as we read the copper bells also did, besides
grains of the cacao fruit, bales of cotton, axes and
other articles of common necessity.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus much, and no more, we were able to glean from the
early literature of the Conquest and from the paintings of
the natives. As we anticipated at the outset, the testimony
bearing on copper industry among the early Mexicans is
altogether incomplete and lacks that fulness of description
in which those writers indulge when treating topics of social
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>customs, religious rites, or monstrous idols. In but few
instances the pictures gathered from the codices illustrate
the dim suggestions and the doubtful wording of the Spanish
text, so as to give at least a general idea of the localities
where the copper ores were obtained, of the process of
smelting, of the moulds that were used, and the objects or
tools that were produced by these means.</p>

<p class='c013'>One point however we think we have come very near
deciding, and one which when collecting our notes was
constantly in mind, namely: Whether the Mexican bronze
was to be viewed as an artificial or a natural product?
There was a great doubt concerning this question caused by
the first notices respecting the composition of the bronze.
The expressions of Cortes and Bernal Diaz were of so condensed
a character that we were at a loss how to reduce
them to their elementary meaning, and the doubt was not
removed when examining apart each of the subsequent
writers on the same subject. But when putting their statements
together, a certain basis, at least, could be obtained,
from which to deduce a settled opinion. From the combined
statements we learned that the bronze found among
the natives contained a rich basis of copper, which was
mixed either with gold, or with silver, or with tin, and
we might infer from this variety of admixtures, that
the natives manufactured their <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">laton</span></i> according to a
fixed method. But, on the contrary, as the three metals
named are always found to be the steady components
of Mexican copper ore, we are led to the presumption, that
these ores were worked in their unaltered condition, just as
nature had produced them. It is not indeed meant to teach
thereby, that the native did not appreciate the fact, that
copper of a deep red was softer than that of a lighter
color. Whenever they had to manufacture a chisel and had
a choice between the two qualities, we are certain they
would have employed the lighter metal for this purpose.
But we hardly believe that they considered the light metal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>to be a composition of the red colored copper with either
silver, gold or tin. This belief would involve a presupposition
of metallurgical science in the early Mexicans,
that we have not the least knowledge they had ever
attained to. On the other hand, however, there is a strong
reason for the belief, that they recognized this light metal to
be related to the red copper. For if they had thought this
bronze or <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">laton</span></i> to be a separate kind of metal, they would
have had a separate name for it, as they had for all the
other metals, from the gold down to the tin, and even to the
cinnabar. Bronze would have been called <i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">tepuzque</span></i> as was
copper, but probably—with the addition descriptive either of
color or of hardness.</p>

<p class='c013'>We were unable to discover one single hint, from which
to infer that they possessed the knowledge of hardening
copper by dipping the hot metal into water. This is a hypothesis,
often noted and spoken of, but which ranges under
the efforts made for explaining what we have no positive
means to verify or to ascertain.</p>

<p class='c013'>Though we have gained so little from our researches, this
little, however, we hope may incite others to extend their
investigations, and thus render the path clearer which we have
tried to explore into this field of prehistoric industry. The
most substantial proofs and contributions may be expected
from our fellow-students in Mexico. They dwell upon the
ground which was the scene of this ancient industry. They
are also in a continuous contact with a numerous indigenous
race, which despite of European attempts to improve their
working facilities, still tenaciously cling to their old usages
and fashions. Our Museums are overcrowded with Mexican
idols, pottery, and flint arrow-heads. One specimen of an
ancient tin-borer, one of a copper axe or hoe, or of a bronze
chisel would be counted as a very welcome and valuable
acquisition.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>NOTE BY THE COMMITTEE OF PUBLICATION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The Publishing Committee are glad of the opportunity to print
another paper from the pen of Professor Valentini. His previous contributions
have been favorably received by some of the most competent
judges. He is always ingenious and suggestive, taking care to sustain
his views by adequate collateral information, and leaving an impression
of earnestness and thoroughness, even though the reader should not be
able always to see the way through his bold inferences to the important
conclusions deduced from them.</p>

<p class='c013'>It seems apparent that new phases of opinion respecting the position
in the world’s history held by the races occupying the central portions
of the American Continent may be looked for in the near future. Or
rather, perhaps, it may be claimed that vestiges of ancient and independent
culture, of revolutions, conquests, and changing dynasties,
extending back to a remote period of time, which have hitherto simply
excited and bewildered travellers and explorers, bid fair to be subjected
to tests and comparisons derived from wider and closer observation,
for which the means are accumulating, and from which definite results
are anticipated.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is remarkable how one tidal wave of investigation after another
has, at different eras, invaded and receded from these regions, carrying
from them more or less of the fragments of their architectural, monumental,
and pictorial records—the sources of doubtful and unsatisfactory
interpretation. The Spanish chroniclers; the scientists of the
period of Humboldt and his contemporaries; the French government and
the learned societies of France, uniting their efforts to render effective
the honest but undisciplined enthusiasm of Brasseur de Bourbourg; all
have experienced a subsidence of interest arising mainly from a want of
success in yielding a sufficiently plausible solution of a mysterious subject.
The death of Brasseur, the fall of Maximilian, and the political
distractions of the French government and people, are not alone the
causes of suspended action on the part of the learned bodies of France.
They deemed it prudent to discredit the judgment and correctness of
their own agent. One at least of Brasseur’s Commission publicly
disavowed responsibility for his opinions; and his attempt to interpret
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>the Codex Troano by means of the alphabet of Bishop Landa was
pronounced by themselves to be a failure.</p>

<p class='c013'>How signally the explorations of Del Rio, of Dupaix, of Galindo, and
of De Waldeck, failed to make a permanent impression on the public
mind! How soon the illustrated narrative of Stephens became in a
measure disregarded, and even his reliableness questioned! How completely
the nine ponderous folios of Lord Kingsborough’s extensive
collection fell dead from the press, until the great work to which he had
devoted his life and his entire fortune sold in the market for less than a
single useless production of Increase or Cotton Mather! We have seen
the elaborate and learned essays of Gallatin upon Mexican civilization
slumbering with the long sleep of the Ethnological Society; the Geographical
Society cautious about travelling out of the routes of
regular expeditions; even the sardonic “Nation,” assumed arbiter in
literature, politics, and science, and always ready for caustic criticism,
hesitating to venture far beneath the surface of these important
inquiries. The ill-fated Berendt has perished in the midst of his unfinished
labors; and, lastly, one of the most purely philosophical investigators
of Indian habits and history reasons in a direction opposed to
the antiquity and extent of aboriginal civilization.</p>

<p class='c013'>If there is to be a renewal of interest in Mexican archæology, and a
revived consciousness of something more to be gained from the relics
of culture among the early races of this continent (a meaning in its
mystical remains that has not been developed), our Society may claim
its share in the re-kindling or fostering of the newly excited impulse.
In saying this we do not overlook the preparation which recent studies
of the general condition of prehistoric races has created for such
investigations; but, in this particular field, it has had the fortune to
draw special attention to certain regions and opportunities of research.
This has been due to the earnest and liberal exertions of one of its
members, who, some years since, passed a winter in Yucatan, and has
kept up a correspondence with friends and acquaintances there.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c014'><sup>[26]</sup></a>
He embodied his observations and experiences in a report on behalf
of the Council rendered in 1876. He has since endeavored to promote
the operations of Dr. and Mrs. Le Plongeon in the actual field,
and has assisted in preparing the papers of Professor Valentini for our
publications, providing illustrations in all cases when practicable. The
Report of the Council in the present number of “Proceedings” is largely
devoted to an account, by the writer<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c014'><sup>[27]</sup></a> of a visit to the city of Mexico,
and his observations upon the country and its history. More than
twelve years ago, in January, 1868, a generous member of the Society<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c014'><sup>[28]</sup></a>
had the forethought to establish a department of the library
composed of books relating to Spanish America, beginning with the gift
of Lord Kingsborough’s mammoth publication, and others, for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>specialty of antiquities, and accompanied by a pecuniary foundation for
future growth. The importance of a provision for this particular purpose
becomes daily more conspicuous as attention is directed to that
portion of the continent.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is gratifying to perceive that such movements, with the greater
activity in publishing its “Anales” on the part of the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Museo Naçional
de México</span>, and the issue of such publications as that of Prof. Rau by
the Smithsonian Institution,<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c014'><sup>[29]</sup></a> and the private work of Mr. Short,<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c014'><sup>[30]</sup></a> are
not without their influence.</p>

<p class='c013'>The scheme, which, although not fully matured, we have reason to
believe a real one, of sending an expedition to some of the original
Mexican provinces for a thorough exploration, at the cost of a wealthy
citizen of New York, the results to be printed in the North American
Review, may be regarded as one of the fruits of the “<em>Renaissance</em>.”</p>

<h3 class='c011'><span class='sc'>Introductory Remarks.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>In the ensuing discussion an attempt is made to explain
the so-called “Katunes of Maya history.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The Manuscript which bears this name is written in the
Maya language, and its discovery is of comparatively recent
date. At its first publication in 1841 it could not fail to
attract the attention of all those who were engaged in the
study of ancient American history, because it unveiled a
portion of the history of Yucatan, which had been till
then entirely unknown and seriously missed. At that date
only a scanty number of data, loosely described, and referring
to an epoch removed from the Spanish conquest of
the Peninsula by only a few decades, had appeared as the sole
representatives of a long past, in which the builders of the
ruined cities undoubtedly must have lived an eventful life,
not to be counted by a few generations, but by a long and
hardly calculable number of centuries. This vacuum of
time the manuscript promised to fill out. Though it did
not offer a history conceived in the common acceptation of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>word, the brief epitome of events which it presented, began
by telling us of the arrival of foreigners from distant lands,
who, step by step succeeded in conquering the Maya soil and
who were brought into significant connection with the name
as well as the fall of cities now lying in ruins over the whole
country.</p>

<p class='c013'>As to the authenticity of the events reported, they have been
received by many students with a confidence and faith rarely
manifested when discoveries of such importance are brought
to light. As to the form in which they were presented,
the author seemed to exhibit neither the skill of a professional
nor the clumsiness of an occasional forger. If on the one hand
the gaps he left betrayed a defective memory, this circumstance
should be held rather as an indication of his credibility.
The material from which his information was derived, we
might add, was extensive, and much of it was probably lost
when he gave the account at a later period of his life.</p>

<p class='c013'>The events communicated being in themselves of the
highest interest, rose in importance from the fact that
they were arranged in successive epochs. A chance was
thereby given to calculate the long space of time that intervened
between the arrival of the ancient and of the modern
conquerors. This difficult task was attempted by the fortunate
discoverer himself, Señor Juan Pio Perez, of Yucatan,
accompanied by a learned discussion on ancient Maya chronology.
His calculation furnishes the sum of 1392 years,
the first initial date to be assigned to the year 144 A.&nbsp;D., and
the last to 1536 A.&nbsp;D.</p>

<p class='c013'>When, some years ago we undertook to examine the argument
of Señor Perez we were not at all astonished by the great
antiquity of the date he had drawn from the Maya Manuscript.
For, nearly at the same time, we had reached similar
results in an attempt made to utilize certain records
which Ixtlilxochitl (1590), and Veytia (1760), (Kingsborough
Collection, Vols. 8 and 9), have left regarding the earliest
chronology of the Nahuatl tribes. By adopting a more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>rational method of computation than these Mexican writers
had followed, we were unable to withstand the conclusion,
that the Nahuatl people who were immediate territorial
neighbors of the Mayas, considered the year 258 A.&nbsp;D. the
earliest date of their arrival on and occupancy of the Mexican
soil. Thus we had reached in this line of investigation
very nearly the same results with the Nahuatl as Señor Perez
with the Maya chronology, and the suspicion began to dawn
upon us that these two neighboring people might, possibly,
have stood in a still closer than a mere territorial connection.</p>

<p class='c013'>These results, however, were only of a very problematical
nature. They were derived from written reports, which,
after all, could not be regarded as unquestionable authority.
But they received a strong confirmation from a discovery
we made later on the so-called Mexican Calendar Stone. In
our discussion of this monument we believe that we have
given ample proof of the fact, that its principal zone contains
a sculptured record, showing a series of numerical
symbols, from the computation of which the year 231
A.&nbsp;D. resulted as that which the Nahuatls had accepted as
the first date of their national era.</p>

<p class='c013'>Records presented in stone and compiled by the nation
whose history they convey, must always be considered the
most authentic evidence of historical truth. Now, were we
also so fortunate as to possess some Maya monument, similar
to the Mexican Calendar Stone, and were we also able to
decipher it, we should thereby have the means for determining
whether Maya chronology extended back to an epoch
different from that of the Nahuatl, or to one identical with
it. That such a monument once existed we have no doubt.
That it may still exist, we have no reasonable grounds for
denying the possibility. It remains, however, still to be discovered
and to be interpreted. But since the fortunate
discovery has not yet been made, we must rest satisfied for
the present with conclusions derived from extant written
records. The only manuscript of this character thus far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>brought to light, is that said to have been found at Mani,<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c014'><sup>[31]</sup></a>
which was translated by Señor Perez from the Maya language,
and accompanied by a very valuable chronological
interpretation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Since the close revision we undertook of the latter, brought
out very striking coincidences of early Maya dates with
those of the Nahuatl, and especially with that indicated on
the Calendar Stone, we thought it worth while to reprint
the manuscript, to discuss its contents again, and to arrange
them under new points of view. Regarded by itself, the
manuscript, indeed, might seem of only doubtful value in
settling an important chronological question. But the comparison
of its earliest date with that of the Nahuatl monument
will enhance the value of each of them, because they
may be considered as corroborative of each other.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—This Manuscript has also an introduction and close, which
Señor Perez has not published, because the dates specified occurred in
the Spanish epoch, and consequently were of no interest to the Maya
student.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><span class='sc'>History of the Manuscript.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>In the interest of authenticity it is much to be regretted
that neither the name of the author, his residence, nor the
date when the Manuscript was written, are known to us,
and we are also ignorant of other matters of moment;
whether the Manuscript is an original or a copy, or how
often copied, or by what family or person it may have been
preserved before it came into the hands of Don Juan Pio
Perez. That Yucatecan gentleman had retired from Mérida,
the capital, to the District of Peto, to devote himself to
his favorite studies, the ancient language and the history
of his nation. The unusual interest that he showed in this
direction, united to his influential position as first officer of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>the district, enabled him to obtain many small manuscript
documents known to have been written by the natives in
their vernacular language, the Maya, soon after the time of
the conquest, which, for the most part, contained historical
reminiscences of the time of the supremacy of their ancestors.
Among these manuscripts there was a so-called <cite><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Chilam
Balam</span> Calendar</cite>, which, in the form of an appendix, contained,
besides, the outlines of the primitive history of Yucatan.
It was, indeed, but a brief epitome of historical events,
accompanied by the corresponding dates. But its value consisted
in the circumstance that these dates were catalogued
according to successive epochs; and it required only slight
inspection to disclose the fact that they extended back to
a period not very distant from our Christian Era.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was a discovery to the learned world as welcome as
any that could be made. It was unique in its kind. All
attempts, thus far, had vainly sought to learn something
about the history of the builders of those palaces and temples
with whose ruins the peninsula was covered at the date of
the arrival of the Spaniards, and which pointed to a long
past and to the unceasing activity of a numberless population,
which, while it was skilled in the most important branches
of art and industry, and familiar with a luxury such as only
ancient Asia and India had displayed, was yet governed by
a despotic and hierarchical power. The native, when asked
whose work the ruins were, would answer nothing but
that they owed their origin to men who, in ancient times,
had immigrated from far distant countries.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Manuscript disclosed at once the history of these
strange immigrants, showed the progressive march of the
conquest, and the contemporaneous foundation of the largest
cities then in ruins, and furnished in the Maya language
the chronology of each event and its corresponding epoch.
By means of his extensive antiquarian knowledge Señor
Perez made an exact translation of this Manuscript into
Spanish, and afterwards undertook a critical interpretation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>of its contents, and accompanied the whole with an introductory
explanation of the system of ancient Maya chronology.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the midst of these labors he was surprised by the arrival
of the celebrated American traveller and archæologist,
John Lloyd Stephens, and was induced to entrust to him a
copy of the MSS. and interpretations to be embodied in his
work on Yucatan, in order to bring them more fully before
the world. His wishes were scrupulously complied with,
and the Spanish translation has been rendered into literal
English by Mr. Stephens in “Incidents of Travel in Yucatan,”
vol. I., Appendix, pages 434–459, and vol. II., Appendix,
pages 465–469.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Albert Gallatin, who, of all American students, has
made himself most thoroughly acquainted with what remains
of the historical elements of the Nahuatl and Maya people,
has brought together the results of his investigations in a
lecture published in the “Transactions of the American
Ethnological Society,” New York, 1858, vol. I., pages 104–114.
The information therein contained attests an entire
familiarity with the method pursued by Señor Perez in his
commentary, without, indeed, undertaking any severe criticism
of it. In our opinion Mr. John L. Stephens and Mr.
Gallatin are the only Americans who have recognized Señor
Perez’s merits in an unequivocal manner, and have brought
them to the knowledge of the world.</p>

<p class='c013'>This is all we could learn about the Manuscript, nor have
we been able to form a supposition, much less to discover in
the text itself any clue to the source from which the unknown
Maya author could have drawn his data. At the end of the
Manuscript Señor Perez gives his opinion that the whole
was written from memory, because it must have been done
long after the conquest, and after Bishop Landa had
publicly destroyed much of the historical picture-writing of
the Mayas by an <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">auto-da-fé</span></i>, and because the whole narration
is so concise and condensed that it appears more like
an index than a circumstantial description of events.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>These opinions of Señor Perez might cast a well grounded
suspicion on the authenticity of the manuscript. We shall
try to remove such doubts, at once, by presenting the following
considerations. We do not believe that Bishop Landa
succeeded in burning the entire treasures of Maya literature
at the notorious <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">auto-da-fé</span></i> in the town of Mani
in 1561. The authorities<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c014'><sup>[32]</sup></a> to which we have access describe
the number of the destroyed objects so precisely that we
have every reason to confide in their correctness. We read
of 5,000 idols of different size and form, 13 large altar
stones, 22 smaller stones, 197 vessels of every form and
size, and lastly of 27 rolls (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic</span></i>) on deerskin covered with
signs and hieroglyphics, given to destruction at that time
and place. We may believe that the terrorism exercised
by Bishop Landa had a powerful influence on the minds
and on the newly converted consciences of the natives,
and the Bishop no doubt used every possible means to get
into his hands as much as he could of what he considered
to be “cabalistic signs and invocations to the devil.” But
we can never believe that these 27 rolls represented the
entire Maya literature, collected for hundreds of years
with the greatest care and held sacred by the natives.
Such a wholesale destruction would have been an impossibility.
We could refer to a similar occurrence that took
place in Mexico; and though Bishop Zumarraga has the
bad reputation of having destroyed all the picture treasures
of the Nahuatls by an <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">auto-da-fé</span></i>, there were notwithstanding
so many of them in existence soon after his time in the
possession of native families that Ixtlilxochitl, Tezozomoc,
and others, were able to build up their detailed accounts of the
primitive history of their country from these original sources.
Possibly numbers of them may have been preserved among
the Maya tribes, for only under such favorable conditions
could Cogolludo, Villagutierre and Lizana have obtained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>the valuable information and material which form the chief
interest of their labors and researches, and which enabled
also Pio Perez in the year 1835, to discover material from
which to interpret so complete a description of the system
of Maya chronology. Nay, even, we have a suspicion that
Bishop Landa may have laid aside the most important part
of these records, or what was the most intelligible to him,
for we cannot comprehend how he would have been able
without these pictures before his eyes to present in his work
the symbols for the days so correctly, and also those for the
months, or how otherwise he could have written his work
in Spain, so far removed from all sources of information
and from consultation with the natives.</p>

<p class='c013'>No reason, therefore, exists why the Maya author
should not have remained in possession of some painting,
which exhibited the annals of his forefathers. If,
however, he was compelled to write his “Series of
Katunes” from memory, there is no reason for not relying
on the accuracy of his retentive faculties alone. The
noble Indians, and he belonged undoubtedly to this
class, were very particular in training their sons to learn by
heart songs expressing the glorious deeds of their ancestors.
It is a fact attested by the Spanish chroniclers, that these
songs were recited publicly in the temples and on solemn
religious occasions. They were the only kind of positive
knowledge with which we know the brains of the Indian
pupils were burdened. In either case, therefore, the
accuracy of the written Maya report needs not be doubted,
at least not on the grounds alleged. Had it been composed
in the Spanish language instead of Maya, we should have
viewed this circumstance with a more critical eye. But as
the native under Spanish rule expressed it in his native language,
this kind of loyalty appears to us to give a certain
warranty of dealing with a man who described the traditions
of his oppressed race, and who wished to perpetuate its
memory by handing down to posterity the principal events
of the past history of his nation.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>At this place, we should not like to omit pointing out
an interesting suggestion which the clear headed and
sagacious author, Señor Eligio Ancona<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c014'><sup>[33]</sup></a> made in his before
mentioned work, that Bishop Landa and the author of the
Manuscript agree so often in their mention of historic dates,
in the manner as well as the matter, as to lead to the idea that
both drew their information from the same source. Whatever
be its origin, we agree with the views of Señor Perez,
that, in spite of the deficiency and breaks occurring in the
Manuscript, it deserves critical attention as the only document
thus far discovered that gives information of the early
history of Yucatan.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><span class='sc'>Elements of Maya Chronology.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>It is impossible to understand the Manuscript before
obtaining a knowledge of the division of time prevalent in
Yucatan before the Spanish Conquest. Señor Perez has
the incontestable merit of having been the first to lay
before the world not only the chief points of the system
but also all the technical details. Before his time but little
was known of Maya chronology. From the great historic
works of Torquemada, Herrera and Cogolludo, we learn
only that the Mayas, in conformity with the Mexicans,
held that the solar year was composed of 360 days, and
when these were passed they added 5 days more as a correction.
We are told that both nations divided their years
into 18 months, and their months into twenty days each.
As to the longer periods of time, however, we hear of
certain differences. While the Mexicans had an epoch of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>52 years which they divided into 4 smaller periods, the so
called <i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">Tlapilli</span></i>, each of 13 years, the Mayas counted a great
epoch of 260 years, the so called <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Ahau Katun</span></i>, subdivided
into 13 smaller periods each of 20 years, with the simple
name <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Ahau</span></i>. This period of 20 years was according to
Cogolludo<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c014'><sup>[34]</sup></a> subdivided again into what he calls <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">lustra</span></i> of
5 years each, but he does not give the native name of this
division.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>The discovery of the Manuscript, no doubt, induced
Señor Perez to make a systematic and detailed sketch of
the early native chronology of his country. We shall mention
only the most interesting and important of his details
and refer the reader for the rest to Stephens’ work already
mentioned. The names of the 20 days in the month are as
follows:—</p>

<p class='c013'>As the table shows their year began with the first day of
the month Pop, which corresponded to the 16th of July in our
calendar, when, as Señor Perez observes, the sun was almost
vertical over the Peninsula. The day itself was called
<i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Kin</span></i>, Sun, the month <i>U</i>, Moon, and the 5 intercalary days
were called nameless days, <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Xona-Kaba-Kin</span></i>, not-name-Sun.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the arrangement of their yearly calendar the Mayas
proceeded as follows: Like the Mexicans they used a combination
of the numbers 1 to 13, with the names of the 20
days of the month. They called the first day of the month
Pop (our 16 July) 1 Kan, the second 2 Chicchan, the third
3 Quimij, and so on. The fourteenth day was called 1
Caban, the fifteenth 2 Edznab, and the last or twentieth day
7 Akbal. The first day of the second month followed in
correct numerical sequence with the name 8 Kan, the second
with the name 9 Chicchan. Thus repeating the 20 names of
the days with the above combination of numbers from 1 to
13 they reached the 360th day with the name 9 Akbal.
Then followed the intercalary week of 5 days bearing the
names 10 Kan, 11 Chicchan, 12 Cimij, 13 Manik, and 1
Lamat.</p>

<p class='c013'>The second year begins with 2 Muluc. In the same manner
going on with the combination the first day of the third
year was 3 Hix, then followed 4 Cavac, 9 Kan, 10 Muluc, 11
Hix, 12 Cavac, 13 Kan, 1 Muluc, 2 Hix, and so on. At the
end of the 52d year the above-mentioned combination was exhausted,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>for the 53d year began again with the day 1

<p class='c013'>It is to be observed here that this arrangement of a
calendar of epochs agrees with that in use in the interior of
Mexico. There, the numbers from 1 to 13 were combined
with four names, Tecpatl, Calli, Tochtli and Acatl, which
they had taken, like the Mayas, from the names for the 20
days of the month; and both calendars represent the first
days of their weeks of five days as occurring upon the 1st,
6th, 11th and 16th days of the month. From this system
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Señor Perez arrives at the division into great epochs of 52
years used in Mexico as well as in Yucatan. This statement
appears hazardous in the highest degree when compared
with the statements made by the before-mentioned authorities.
They claim for Yucatan an epoch of 20 and 260 years
respectively; and Landa, who wrote with the first impressions
of the conquest still fresh in his mind, and whose
information came directly from the natives themselves,
agrees with them. Without doubt Señor Perez must have
been aware of this contradiction. After he had developed
in §7 the so-called epoch of the Mayas of 52 years he
makes us acquainted with this national Maya epoch, though,
as we shall presently learn, he disagrees with the Maya
writers as to the time of its duration. His statement is: §8.
“The Yucatecans, besides the great cycle of 52 years,
employed still another great cycle, which had reference
to certain portions of it, in order to date the main
epoch, and the most notable events of their history. Each
of these cycles contained 13 periods, of 24 years each, making
together 312 years. Each period, or <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Ahau-Katun</span></i> was
divided into two parts. The first of these parts of 20 years
was enclosed in a square (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic</span></i>), and was called on that account
<i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">amaytun</span></i>, <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">lamayte</span></i> or <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">lamaytun</span></i>. The second part
of 4 years formed, so to speak, a pedestal for the first part,
and was called <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">chek oc Katun</span></i>, or <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">lath oc Katun</span></i>, which
signifies a <em>chair</em> or pedestal. These years were considered
intercalary, and were held to be unlucky years. They were
called <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">u yail Jaab</span></i>, and the same was the case with the 5
intercalary days to which they corresponded. The separation
of the 20 years from the following 4 years gave rise to
the erroneous idea that the <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Ahaues</span></i> consisted of twenty
years only, an error which has prevailed almost universally
among those who have written upon this subject. But if
they had counted the years which compose a period, and
had taken notice of the positive declarations of the manuscript
to the effect that the <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Ahaues</span></i> consisted of 24 years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>divided as above stated, they would not have misled their
readers on this point.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Señor Perez continues:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is an incontrovertible fact that those Maya periods,
epochs or ages, took their name from <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Ahau Katun</span></i>, for they
began to be counted from the day which bore the name
<i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Ahau</span></i>, the second day of those years, which began with the
name <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Cavac</span></i>. But as these days and numbers were taken
from years which had run their course, the periods of 24
years could never maintain an arithmetical order, but succeeded
each other according to the following arrangement
of numbers: 13, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2. As the
Indians considered the number 13 the initial number, it is
probable that some remarkable event had happened in that
year, because, when the Spaniards arrived in the Peninsula,
the Indians then counted the 8th as the 1st, that being the
date at which their ancestors came to settle there; and an
Indian writer proposed that they should abandon that order
also, and begin counting from the 11th, solely because the
Conquest had happened in that Ahau. Now, if the 13th
Ahau Katun began on a second day of the year, it must be
that year which began on 12 Cavac, and the 12th of the
series. The 11th Ahau would commence in the year of 10
Cavac, which occurred after a period of 24 years, and so on
with the rest; taking notice that after the lapse of years we
come to the respective number marked in the course of the
Ahaues which is placed first; proving that they consisted of
24, and not, as some have believed, of 20 years.”</p>

<p class='c013'>From the heading (§8), “<em>Of the Great Cycle of 312
years, or Ahau Katunes</em>,” as well as of the text just quoted,
it is apparent that Señor Perez intended to establish the
fact that the ancient Maya cycles were composed of 24 and
312 years respectively. He does so in manifest contradiction
to the prevalent opinion that they consisted of 20
and 260 years. We do not understand the reasons why
he should have come to this conclusion. It grew out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>neither from the facts alleged nor from the connection into
which he wove them together. The peculiar circumstance
of having, in his commentary references, four years intercalated
in succession to the usual cycle of twenty years, and
included in a square, to serve as a “<em>pedestal</em>” to the former,
is not capable of shedding new light upon the question and
causing us to distrust authorities on which we were accustomed
to rely. The other reason, which stands second in his order of
forming premises for his conclusion, is said to be the undeniable
fact, that those periods took their name of <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Ahau Katun</span></i>,
because they began to be counted from the day Ahau, which
was the second day of those years that began in <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Cavac</span></i>.
Of this incontrovertible fact the readers are not elsewhere
informed. The information, however, which we are able to
give is that according to all we have been able to gather on
the Maya Calendar, a period, or a single year, commencing
with a day named <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Ahau</span></i>, has never existed in their system
of counting. They always commenced it with the words
<span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn"><em>Kan</em>, <em>Muluc</em>, <em>Hix</em>, <em>Cavac</em></span>. If there existed any exceptional
ground for changing an old established method of dating,
the reason should have been stated, for it is preposterous to
assume that the first day of a great cyclical period should
have taken its name from any other day of the year’s calendar
than from the four above named. Nor do we understand
the reason why, just here, the topic of the succession
of the numbers 13, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, was
introduced. Could it have been with the intention of showing
that this singular enumeration of alternating <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Ahaues</span></i>,
which we shall hereafter speak of, occurred only in cycles
of 24 years, and that therefrom a proof might be derived
for establishing the pretended cycle of 24 and 312 years?
Evidence of this should have been given by a table showing
the series, and by still another table in which should be
shown that such an alternating succession did not occur in
cycles composed of 20 years. Not one single fact can be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>detected in Señor Perez’s text, by which the long established
assumption of a 20 years’ cycle has been disproved.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nevertheless, the data which we possess of the ancient
Maya Calendar are not so complete as to disprove emphatically
that a cycle of 24 and 312 years respectively was
never used by the Maya chronologers.</p>

<p class='c013'>Without doubt, Yucatan owed its ancient greatness to the
success of uniting a rude and scattered population around a
number of theocratical centres, where similar forms of
worship were maintained. Though the ancient records are
wanting, this feature of the Maya system stands out upon
the background of dim traditions with great distinctness.
After this concentration of tribes, and with the view of
regulating worship, a uniform calendar would have been
introduced, the main features of which would probably have
been a solar year of 365 days, the division of the year into
20 months, and a cyclical period of 20 and 260 years respectively.
In the middle of the 11th century great tribal
revolutions took place on the high plateaus of Anahuac,
by which the lowlands of Yucatan were also affected. An
adventurous tribe of the Nahuatl stock possessed itself of
one of the principal towns of Yucatan and established its
influence and power. Mayapan became the centre of
Nahuatl worship. The calendar the invaders brought
with them must have been the old honored division of the
years into 365 days, with 20 months, and their cyclical
period of not 20 but 52 years, and it is also known that about
the year 1450, the political union of the Mayas was broken
into several smaller divisions, some of which presumably
would have held to the ancient cycle of 20 years; others
may have adopted the Nahuatl cycle of 52 years, and possibly,
may have introduced the cycle of 24 years spoken of by
Señor Perez. Political schism was likely to have generated
also a hierarchical one, and each newly formed body of
priests, in whose hands the custody and composition of annals
fell, would have sought to distinguish themselves from their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>predecessors by innovations, if only of a formal character.
Such changes we also observe among the Nahuatls in
Anahuac. The period of 52 years, however, seems to have
constantly prevailed among them, and also the divisions of
the 365 days into 18 months of 20 days each.</p>

<p class='c013'>We find, for instance, that one of the Nahuatl tribes
begins its annals with December 9, another selects
December 26, another January 9, and others January 12,
February 4, and February 22. We also know that a
different calculation prevailed among these tribes in beginning
their annals. The State of Colhuacan began its
chronology with a year 1 <i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">Calli</span></i>, the State of Mexico with
2 <i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">Acatl</span></i>, others with 1 <i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">Tochtli</span></i>, and seemingly the most
ancient calculation began with the year 1 <i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">Tecpatl</span></i>. Thus
we have a historical basis for our assertion that the Nahuatl
as well as the Maya tribes did not conform to a uniform
rule in beginning their first year’s date, in their chronological
epochs, or in the division of their cyclical epochs.</p>

<p class='c013'>In spite of this diversity, so perplexing to modern chronologists,
the Aztecs and the Mayas were both governed by
the same general principle in arranging their calendars.
Both nations recognized the fact that in the past their solar
year had numbered only 360 days; and they preserved in
the words <span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">nemotemi</span> and <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">xona-kaba-kin</span>, the remembrance
of a not to be forgotten effort exerted by their ancestors to
correct the primordial solar year of 360 days into one of 365
days. Both nations conscientiously kept on dividing the year
into 18 months, and each of the months into 20 days, and
with both the number 13 returns as a basis governing the
calendar of years as well as that of periods.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c014'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>We notice, moreover, that both nations omit to count the
20 days of the month in the succession of the figures 1–20,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>but after the thirteenth day they again begin with the number
1, and the 20th day therefore was figured with the
number 7, and also that the Mexicans counted their smallest
period with 13 years, the so-called <i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">tlapilli</span></i>, and upon its
quadruple the cycle of 52 years was based. The lesser
Maya or <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Ahau</span></i> period is 20 years, while the greater or
<i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Ahau Katun</span></i> is 260 years or 13 times the smaller. Señor
Perez’s lesser period of 24, and the greater one of 312
years show the same method and calculation (13 × 24 = 312).</p>

<p class='c013'>This conformity between the early calendars of Central
America should not escape the observation of the future
historical enquirer. He will be compelled to adopt a
very remote period of time when both nations, differing
so entirely in their language, dwelt in peace, connected
by the strong bands of a hierarchical power. One of these two
nations, it is clear, must have invented it. Hence the
question arises, was it original with the immigrating
Nahuatl tribes who came from the higher northern countries
as is reported, and did they succeed in forming
such a consolidation with the Maya races as to mingle both
under the same hierarchical government, or did the contrary
take place? The most prevalent opinion makes the Nahuas
the inventors of the general system of chronology, but later
students begin to express themselves in favor of its Maya
origin. On a more fitting occasion we are desirous to
present our reasons for taking the latter view.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before passing from these chronological speculations to
the discussion of the Maya Manuscript, we wish to state
briefly our idea of the origin of the system of reckoning
by alternating Ahaues. [See page <a href='#Page_66'>66</a>]. We promised to
return to this subject, and shall now endeavor to give
a solution to this chronological problem differing from
that of Señor Perez. A passage in Bishop Landa’s work,
determined our decision. After a previous and positive
assertion that the lesser Ahau period consisted of 20 years,
Landa continues, ... “The order in which they computed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>their dates and made their prophecies by the aid of this
computation (of 20 years) was arrived at by having two
idols, dedicated to two of these characters (<i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Ahaues</span></i>). To
the first idol, which stands with a cross marked above the
circle, they paid homage by making him offerings and sacrifices,
in order to obtain an immunity from the calamities to
come in these 20 years, but after ten of these years had passed
they offered nothing but incense and worship. When the
twenty years of the first were fully passed they began to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>occupy themselves with the presages of their second idol and
to offer sacrifices to him, having taken away their first idol to
replace it by the second, in order to worship it in the coming
ten years.”<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c014'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<div id='illus-071'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus-071.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>AHAU KATUN.<br /><br />[Above we give a reproduction of a Maya Ahau Katun wheel taken from that in Landa’s “<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Las cosas de Yucatan</span>,” § XL., in order that his explanation may be understood.]</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“The Indians say, for example, that the Spaniards arrived
at the City of Mérida in the year of the nativity of our Lord
and Master 1541, which was precisely the first year of <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Buluc
Ahau</span></i> (11 Ahau), the same that we find placed at the top of
the instrument<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c014'><sup>[37]</sup></a> below the cross, and which also indicates that
they arrived in the month <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Pop</span></i>, which is the first in their year.
Had the Spaniards not come as they did, then they would
have placed the Idol of <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Bolon Ahau</span></i> (9 Ahau), offering
homage to it, and continuing to refer to the prognostics of
<i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Buluc Ahau</span></i>, till the year 1561; and then they would take
it from the temple and put in its place that of <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Vuc Ahau</span></i>
(7 Ahau), all the while continuing to refer to the prognostics
of <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Buluc Ahau</span></i>, for ten years more, and the same with
the others until the tour was made. In this way they made
up their Katuns of twenty and ten years, worshipping them
according to their superstitions and juggleries, which were in
such great numbers that there were more than enough to
deceive that simple people, and there is reason for astonishment
when one knows what kind of things in nature and
experience belong to the Demon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Whoever is acquainted with the awkwardness and literary
negligence of Landa’s writing will not be astonished that in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>his statement he left out something which a more careful
writer would have expressed, and placed at the head of his
explanation. The wanting statement, however, can be supplied.
It will be noticed that Landa in his text only refers to
two Ahau Idols worshipped in the temple. But this number
must have been 13, as is evident from the 3d Idol <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Vuc
Ahau</span></i>, mentioned afterwards in the statement with which he
finished his description, in order not to always repeat the same
thing of the ten other idols which are painted on the wheel.
Let us then take the statement of Landa supplemented by
what we have said above as to the questionable nomenclature
of these Ahaues as they appear in the row of numbers
13, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2. Landa’s description
gives us to understand that the lapse of twenty years was
always required before the new combination of two idols
was presented to the worshippers, and which had not before
been seen in the temple in company with the former Idols.
For example: When Idol 3 was placed in the temple, Idol
2 took a first place among the worshippers. Indeed, Idol 2
was in the temple with Idol 1, but Idol 3 was not with Idol
1, nor Idol 4 with Idol 2. If such a combination repeating
itself after 20 years, represented a space of time familiar
to the Mayas, it is natural that it should receive the name
Ahau or period of the <em>god</em>,<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c014'><sup>[38]</sup></a> and that it should receive its
name from the number of the Idol presiding at the expiration
of this space of 20 years. If therefore in the rotation
of the circle Idols 2 and 3 passed out of the temple, the
combination, or what is the same, the space of 20 years,
during which they had ornamented the temple will have
borne the name 2 <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Ahau</span></i>, on the ground that Idol 2 had preceded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>it. The second combination, then, would follow
when the presidency of Idol 4 would have finished its term,
and in this way the row 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,
13, may have had its origin.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now, it is true that the order in which these numbers
stand is different from that transmitted to us, which begins with
13 and is followed by 11 and 9. The reverse of this method of
reckoning may possibly be accounted for in this way: An
epoch unknown to us may have occurred when the Maya
chroniclers desired to review past events and bring them
into order. Counting backwards from such a date they
would have called the first period of twenty years not the
13th, nor, according to our above statement, the 1st, but the
2d Ahau. Consequently the period after the expiration of
the great cycles of 260 years would have been called the
13th Ahau, though properly speaking it should have been
the 2d Ahau. An historical epoch for such reckoning backward
is known to have occurred. It occurred again in the
year 1542, when the conquest of Yucatan by the Spaniards
took place. It appears that the Mayas in that year declared
their 13th Ahau period to be at an end, from 1522 to 1542;
consequently a back reckoning, according to this system of
the Mayas, gave a 2d Ahau for the period of 1502–22, a
4th Ahau for that of 1482–1502, and going on in the
same way of reckoning the year 1282 would have represented
the expiration of the 13th <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Ahau</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The circle of Landa exemplifies this manner of counting.
He starts from the 13th Ahau, counting from left to right.
But if we count in the opposite direction we should obtain
the row of numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, &amp;c., as we have shown above.
If we refer to the striking discovery on the Mexican Calendar
stone<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c014'><sup>[39]</sup></a> that the days upon that circle are not counted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>towards the right but towards the left, and generalize it as a
rule to be adopted also for the chronological cycles of the
Mayas, we should come to the conclusion that the Mayas in
some of their former chronological epochs counted their
Ahaues in that natural order. Who shall say that the
reversed counting did not originate from a misunderstanding
on the part of the Spaniards? We do not claim to have
finally disposed of the question. Every new attempt will
be a welcome addition to the cause, for each new investigator
is obliged to descend deeper into the dark mine where
Maya history lies buried.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><span class='sc'>Señor Perez’s Translation of the Manuscript.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>Señor Perez is thus far the only interpreter of the Maya
Manuscript, and his Spanish text found a skilful translator
in Mr. John L. Stephens. Neither the Spanish text nor the
special chronological analysis of each paragraph composed
by Señor Perez, have hitherto been made public; we owe
the possession of both these documents to the kindness of
our friend, Dr. Carl Hermann Berendt, lately deceased, who,
during his long residence in Yucatan, was occupied in amassing
a large collection of matters relating to Maya literature
and history, in original form or in authentic copies. In
comparing the Spanish with the English translations,
it seems that many things, not clear in the first, had
been made more intelligible in the last. It is evident
that Señor Perez sought to translate the Maya text as literally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>and faithfully as he could into the Spanish language,
otherwise his text would have been more fluent and finished.
The abruptness of expression, and the frequent ellipses in
the construction of its sentences, show that the Maya idiom
has been faithfully rendered. Such a course increases the
interest, and at the same time it creates confidence in the
correctness of the translation. Dr. Berendt, the profound
scholar of the Maya language, wrote us as follows on March
14, 1873: “I have several times undertaken to translate
this manuscript myself, but have always given up the task.
The manifold doubts which the original text leaves open
seem to me correctly solved by Señor Perez, and it always
appeared to me that I might indeed make another but not a
better translation. The small changes in the text of Stephens,
of which you speak, I do not believe were introduced
merely from a love of his own expressions. I believe that
he first came to an understanding with Perez, and sought
only to assist the better comprehension of the manuscript
for the benefit of the public at large.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It is to be hoped that the differences of translation of the
manuscript spoken of above, and to which Señor Eligio
Ancona<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c014'><sup>[40]</sup></a> draws attention, will be critically investigated and
finally decided by the coming generation of scholars in Yucatan.
The sons of the country should be the born judges
of the language and the spirit of the literary relics of the
indigenous race. Recent investigations have shown that
this language was split into sixteen dialects, which were
spoken by as many tribes, whose territories extended far beyond
the present area of the Yucatecan peninsula.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c014'><sup>[41]</sup></a> Like all
languages, these Maya idioms have undergone changes during
the last three or four centuries. To understand and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>explain their now obsolete elements, must be left exclusively
to the native scholar.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><span class='sc'>Discussion of the Manuscript.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>It will now be our task to endeavor to clear away such
doubts as may arise in regard to the chronological interpretation
of the Maya Manuscript. These doubts have reference,
first, to the choice of the method to be pursued in
reckoning the Ahaues either at 24 or at 20 years. Second,
as to the manner of filling up certain gaps which the author
has left open in the chronological sequence of the Ahau
period; and finally, after building again this chronological
structure in its logical order, we must adapt the dates
expressed in Ahaues to the current language of our
Christian chronological era.</p>

<p class='c013'>In order to avoid troublesome reference to the text of the
preceding pages, we shall repeat the English translation, and
for better convenience, shall present two or more sections
together. To demonstrate Señor Perez’s system and method
of counting, we shall give the translation of the Spanish
text, as communicated by Dr. Berendt, without undertaking
to make any special criticisms of it.</p>

<p class='c020'><em>This is the series of Katuns that elapsed from the time
of their separation from the land and house of Nonoual,
in which were the four Tutul Xiu, lying to the west of
Zuina, going out of the country of Tulapan.</em></p>

<p class='c013'>With these few words the Maya author states his purpose.
He wishes to enumerate the Katuns or periods of time from
the beginning of the history of his nation to the arrival of
the Spanish conquerors. He tells us that his nation lived
in a land called Tulapan, which was westerly from another
called Zuina, and that from thence, under the lead of four
chiefs, the Tutul Xiu, they had immigrated into this new
country, Yucatan.</p>

considered as the ancient rulers and hereditary lords of
Chichen-Itza.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c014'><sup>[42]</sup></a> In regard to the countries referred to by
the names Tulapan and Zuina, we can only say that in Central
American traditions the name Tulapan oftentimes returns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>under the form of Tulan. Thus, for example, the
Quichés and Cakchiqueles, sister nations of the Mayas, make
mention of the above countries in their annals.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c014'><sup>[43]</sup></a> Upon a
closer examination of the text, contained in the so-called
“Popol Vuh,” we were unable to detect any grounds for
the assumption that these countries or places lay in a distant
orient. They probably will turn out to have been, or by
the annalists were thought to have been, situated on the
northern boundaries of Mexico, on a route of migration
ending with the high plateaus of Guatemala.</p>

they began their journey towards this island, it was the 8th
Ahau, and the 6th, 4th and 2d were spent in travelling,
because in the 1st year of the 13th Ahau they arrived at
this island, making together eighty-one years they were travelling
between their departure from their country and their
arrival at this island of Chacnouitan. These are 81 years.</em></p>

<p class='c013'>We learn that four Ahau periods had passed the 8th, 6th,
4th and 2d before the wanderers arrived with their leader,
Holon Chantepeuh, at the island of Chacnouitan. In the
following 13th Ahau they are said to have been already settled
there. It is of the highest importance to note that the Maya
author here acknowledges that he reckoned each Ahau period
as 20 years, and he remains faithful to this method to the end
of the manuscript. By this fact alone, we should be compelled
to follow the division of 20 years thus established,
even if in contradiction to the statements of other chroniclers,
which fortunately is not the case.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>As the author treats of the affairs of the Tutul Xiu or
the so-called Itza race, and attributes to them the discovery
and colonization of Yucatan, it is highly probable that he
made use of the annals of the Itzaes, and that they were
arranged in periods of just 20 years. If we should be right
in this assumption the 20–year period must be regarded as
the most ancient ever used in Yucatan.</p>

<p class='c013'>We cannot fully agree with Señor Perez and his countrymen
that the author intended to designate the peninsula of
Yucatan when he speaks of the Island of Chacnouitan.
This name appears for the first and only time in this manuscript.
It is generally acknowledged that the name had
never previously been heard of.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c014'><sup>[44]</sup></a> We should state that the
words of the text are always <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">nay ti petene Chacnouitan</span></i>. If
in Maya <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">peten</span></i> meant only a peninsula, we should take no
exceptions. But the fundamental meaning of <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">peten</span></i> is an
island, and as the demonstrative pronoun <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">nay</span></i> means as well
“of this place” as “of that place,” the translation could as well
stand for “that distant island.” Whether the island was situated
in the ocean or in any of the many inland lakes, the probabilities
seem to lie with the latter supposition, for they
came by land. Had they come by sea, tradition would have
dwelt with some characteristic remark upon such an exceptional
case. From the following paragraph it will become
still more evident that the Chacnouitan discovered by the
Itzaes was neither the whole nor the northern part of Yucatan,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>but a district situated in the southwest of the peninsula.</p>

<p class='c020'><em>§2. The 8th Ahau, the 6th Ahau, in the 2d Ahau arrived
Ajmekat<a id='t81'></a> Tutul Xiu, and ninety-nine years they remained
in Chacnouitan—years 99.</em></p>

<p class='c020'><em>§3. In this time also took place the discovery of the Province
of Ziyan-caan or Bacalar; the 4th Ahau and the 2d
Ahau and the 13th Ahau, or sixty years they had ruled in
Ziyan-caan when</em> <span class='fss'>THEY CAME HERE</span>. <em>During these years of
their government of the Province of Bacalar occurred the
discovery of the Province of Chichen-Itza. These are years
60.</em></p>

<p class='c013'>As the first section closed with the arrival at Chacnouitan,
which took place upon the 2d Ahau, it was to be expected
that the second section would continue the sequence of
Ahaues so as to connect with the necessarily following 13th
Ahau. But we see that it begins with the 8th Ahau, follows
with the 6th and closes with the 2d Ahau.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before taking notice of the accounts given in these two
paragraphs let us first ascertain what Ahaues were left out
between the 2d Ahau, at the end of the first section, and
the 8th Ahau, with which the second section begins. According
to the rule above given on the alternating Ahaues,
the missing ones would be the following: The (13), (11),
(9), (7), (5), (3), (1), (12), and (10th) Ahau. Of these nine
Ahaues, or 180 years, the author had nothing in mind to tell
us. No event of significance appears to have taken place.
Perhaps the wanderers had to rest to gather strength before
attempting further conquests. Moreover, this time belongs
to the most ancient epochs of Maya history, and information
regarding it was so dim and so obscure that it appeared
to the author as of no account. The chronological sequence
thus being established, let us now turn to the contents of the
two section, 2 and 3. They begin with the 8th Ahau and
close with the 13th Ahau. As to the events happening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>within the 8th, 6th, 4th, 2d and 13th Ahau, they indeed do
not appear in the wished for sequence. But the sequence, as
will be shown, can be established without making interpolations.
It will be noticed that in section 2 the 4th Ahau is
not mentioned. After having quoted the 8th and 6th Ahau,
the author passes over this 4th Ahau and mentions the arrival
of Ajmekat, belonging to the family of the renowned
Tutul Xiu, who seems to have led in the conquests of
Bacalar and Chichen-Itza, which are recorded in section 3,
as happening in the 4th, 2d and 13th Ahau. That these conquests
must be counted into the epoch mentioned with the
names 8th, 6th, 4th, 2d and 13th Ahau is clearly expressed
by the words, “<em>in this time</em>,” so that no mistake can take
place as to the intimate connection with the arrival of Ajmekat.
We learn moreover that the time which the conquerors
remained in the province of Chacnouitan is said to have
been 99 years. These 99 or 100 years cover exactly the
time represented by the above five Ahaues, and when reading
at the end of the 3d paragraph that they had ruled 60
years in Ziyan-caan Bacalar, it becomes clear that these 60
years are not years that follow the 99 years, but that they
were the last years of the 99 mentioned. The two sections
supplement each other, and from them the following impression
is conveyed, that Chacnouitan was the territory situated
southwest of the shores of the great lagoon of
Bacalar. The wanderers had been waiting during eleven
Ahaues, from the 13th to the 4th Ahau, before they
made an attack against the possessors of Bacalar. An
attempt to take it appears to have been made during the
8th, 6th and 4th Ahaues, and only accomplished in the 2d
Ahau, through the arrival or help of Ajmekat, who led them
further on to the discovery or conquest of Chichen-Itza, in
the 13th Ahau.</p>

<p class='c013'>The difficulty of interpreting the two sections is removed
as soon as we view them in the light of the reasons given,
not as two distinct epochs of which the one follows the other,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>as Señor Perez does (see commentary), but as belonging to
one and the same epoch from the 8th to the 13th Ahau. It
must not be so much questioned what the author ought to
have done in order to represent his history in a logical way,
<em>and on account of his omissions cast a doubt upon the whole
record</em>, as how to use what he has left to construct a system
from these elements, and to avail ourselves unhesitatingly
of the help of the chronological sequence of Ahaues, which
is and will remain the only reliable thread to lead us through
and out of the labyrinth.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Commentary of Señor Perez.</span>—“The manuscript informs us that at
the 8th Ahau a colony of Toltecs under their leader Holon Chantépeuh,
marched out from the city of Tulapan, and that in their wanderings
they spent 4 Ahaues, 8, 6, 4, 2, till they came to Chacnouitan, which
happened in the first year of the 13th Ahau. To doubt this is not possible,
for this statement is the beginning and foundation of all later
dates. According to my calculation which I will explain hereafter, it
was from the year 144 to 217, which is 97 and not 81 years, as the manuscript
reports, for if we <em>compute</em> the Ahaues with 24 years, as we have
shown, and include the first year of the Ahau following as the time of
their arrival, then the account makes 97 years. They stayed in Chacnouitan
with Ajmekat Tutul Xiu during the remaining years of the 13th
Ahau, until the 2d Ahau.</p>

<p class='c020'>These Ahaues, as we have explained, should follow in the order 13,
9, 7, 5, and not 13, 6, 8, 2, for this latter list represents earlier Ahaues,
and as they represent different epochs they can only be expressed by the
same figures after the expiration of 312 years, thereby clearly showing
the error.</p>

<p class='c020'>It is likewise asserted that they remained 99 years in Chacnouitan,
which could not have been true, for this would have made 119 actual
years, or only 95 years if we reckon only four Ahaues, without the
second, for if we regard the succession we miss the 4th Ahau, which
the manuscript has left out. But the manuscript does not count four
but five Ahaues, as it reckons an Ahau at 20 years, the five <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Ahaues</span></i> less
one year make the aforesaid 99 years.”</p>

<p class='c020'><em>§4. The 11th Ahau, 9th, 7th, 5th, 3d and 1st Ahau, or

<p class='c013'>The fourth section, in correct sequence, continues the series
from the 13th Ahau when Chichen-Itza was founded. It
covers the 11th, 9th, 7th, 5th, 3d, and 1st Ahau, a space of
20 years, in which the wanderers make the new region of
Chichen-Itza their metropolis. Enemies, however, whose
names are not indicated, destroy the place and oblige them
to look elsewhere. They then turn to Champutun (now
Champoton, also Potonchan), situated in a southwesterly
direction from Chichen-Itza, on the westerly shore of the
Peninsula.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fifth section should begin with the 12th Ahau, but
instead it follows the 6th Ahau. Hence the (12th), (10th) and
(8th) Ahau are missing. These 60 years may be supposed
to be the time required by the exiles to recuperate their
strength in order to conquer the new territory of Champoton.
In the 6th Ahau then they succeeded in taking Champoton,
and they remained there during the 4th, 2d, 13th,
11th, 9th, 7th, 5th, 3d, 1st, 12th, 10th and 8th Ahaus, a full
<i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Ahau-Katun</span></i> epoch of 260 years. They were obliged to
leave Champoton in the 8th <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Ahau</span></i>, and seemed willing to
return to their old home, but determined to reconquer Champoton.
We are told in the sixth section that two Katuns
or 40 years, were passed in delays and preparations, correctly
figured by the 6th and 4th Ahau; that they then made
an attempt to reconquer Champoton, failing in which, they
were obliged to look about for a new home.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Commentary of Señor Perez to the 4th, 5th and 6th Sections.</span>—They
remained in Chichen-Itza and ruled there until it was destroyed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>when they betook themselves to Champoton. Here they built their
houses during the 11th, 9th, 7th, 5th, 3d and 1st Ahaues (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic</span></i>). If this
succession should be stated correctly it would be the 10th, 8th, 6th, 4th,
2d and 13th Ahau, or from the year 452 to 576, A.&nbsp;D., when the 13th
<i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Ahau</span></i> expired. The Ahaues represented the years 432, 456, 480, 504, 528
and 552 A.&nbsp;D.</p>

<p class='c020'>§5. In the 6th Ahau they took Champoton and held sway there during
the following twelve Ahaues until it was destroyed. After this they
looked again for a home after they had passed several Katunes in the
mountainous regions, which were the 11th, 9th, 7th, 5th, 3d, 1st, 12th,
10th, 8th, 6th, 4th, 2d and 13th Ahaues, making a complete epoch of 312
years. Their coming should not have been stated as the 6th, but the
11th Ahau, according to the explanation.</p>

<p class='c020'>§6. In the 6th and 4th Ahau they again erected houses after they had
lost Champoton, that is after a lapse of 48 years, which requires a connection
with the 11th and 9th Ahau. This occurred in the years 888 to
936 A.&nbsp;D., for the 11th <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Ahau</span></i> began in 888, the 9th in 912, and ended in
the year 936 A.&nbsp;D.</p>

<p class='c020'><em>§7. In this Katun of the 2d Ahau, Ajcuitok Tutul Xiu
established himself in Uxmal; the 2d Ahau, 13th, 11th,
9th, 7th, 5th, 3d, 1st, 12th and 10th Ahau, equal to 200
years, they governed in Uxmal, with the governors of
Chichen-Itza and Mayapan.</em></p>

<p class='c013'>The former section closing with the 4th Ahau, this begins
with the 2d and is followed in correct succession by the 13th,
11th, 9th, 7th, 5th, 3d, 1st, 12th and 10th, a space of 200
years. In the 2d Ahau, under their leader Ajcuitok, they
settled down in a new region at the town of Uxmal. It
appears that Chichen-Itza had been rebuilt, and Mayapan
newly founded. Rulers resided at both places at peace with
the Tutul Xiu at Uxmal.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Commentary of Señor Perez to Section 7.</span>—In the 2d Ahau Ajcuitok
Tutul Xiu made a settlement in Uxmal, and reigned there with the
Governors of Chichen-Itza and Mayapan during 2d, 13th, 11th, 9th, 7th,
5th, 3d, 1st, 12th and 10th Ahau. A correction of these Ahaues gives us
the 7th, 5th, 3d, 1st, 12th, 10th, 8th, 6th, 4th and 2d, and brings them
into harmony with the Christian era, to wit: the years 936, 960, 987,
1008, 1032, 1056, 1080, 1104, 1128 and 1152 A.&nbsp;D. The 2d Ahau ended
with the foundation and with the completion of 240 years in the year
1176, for the foundation took place in the year 936, when the 7th Ahau
just now corrected began.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>§8. <em>These are the Katuns, 11th, 9th and 6th Ahau (sic.)
In the 8th the Governor of Chichen-Itza was deposed because
he murmured disrespectfully against Hunac-eel.
This happened to Chacxibchac of Chichen-Itza, governor
of the fortress of Mayalpan. Ninety years had
elapsed, but the tenth year of the 8th Ahau was the year in
which he was overthrown by Ajzinte-yut-chan with Tzunte-cum,
Taxcal, Pantemit, Xuch-cuet, Ytzcuat and Kakaltecat.
These are the names of the seven Mayalpanes.</em></p>

<p class='c013'>§9. <em>In the same Katun of the 8th Ahau, they attacked
King Ulmil in consequence of his quarrel with Ulil, King
of Yzamal; thirteen divisions of troops he had when he was
routed by Hunac-eel; in the 6th Ahau the war was over
after 34 years.</em></p>

<p class='c013'>As the foregoing section 7 closed with the 10th Ahau, we
should expect section 8 to begin with the 8th Ahau. We
read, however, 11th, 9th and 6th Ahau. This sequence is
evidently incorrect in itself, because the 9th can never be
followed by the 6th Ahau. If the period began with the
11th Ahau, the sequence should follow with the 9th and 7th
Ahau. The correct reading of the text, however, will result
from the examination of that which follows immediately
after this introductory sentence. There we read these
words: “In the 8th Ahau the governor of Chichen-Itza was
deposed,” etc., and this same 8th Ahau is mentioned again in
the sentence that follows, beginning with “Ninety years,”
etc. So also it reappears for a third time in section 9, at
its beginning. Now, as section 8 was expected to commence
with the 8th Ahau, it is more than probable that the author
has blundered in some way. We presume that instead of
11th, 9th and 6th, he intended to write 10th, 8th and 6th.
The 10th would indicate a reference made to the ending of
the last section. The 8th and 6th are those in which all the
events described in our two sections occur, for the insulted
governor Hunac-eel of section 8 is the same who takes revenge
in section 9.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>This difficulty being removed, another arises, how to interpret
the words “ninety years elapsed, but the tenth year of
the 8th Ahau was the year in which he was overthrown,” etc.
This reads as if these ninety years were predecessors of the
8th Ahau. If this were so, they would fall in the 10th, 12th,
1st, 3d and the first half of the 5th Ahau. Of such Ahaues
mention is made in the foregoing section 7. But we notice
these Ahaues were passed in peace and not in war, as our
passage evidently suggests. We cannot help thinking that
another blunder is concealed in this phrase, and that the
author meant to write nine years. If we write, <em>Nine years
had elapsed, but the tenth year of the 8th Ahau was the
year in which he was overthrown</em>, the idea of the author seems
stated correctly. These nine years, then, would have fallen
in the 10th Ahau, with which we proposed to commence
section 8, and nine years added to the twenty years of the
8th Ahau, make twenty-nine years, and five more years of
the 6th Ahau give those thirty-four years, which, at the end
of section 9 are expressly indicated as passed in war. Such
is the sense which we give to these two somewhat perplexing
sections.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Commentary of Señor Perez to Sections 8 and 9.</span>—The Ahaues
11th, 9th, 6th and 8th passed away, and in the latter the governor Hunac-eel
of Mayapan overthrew Chacxibchac, the governor of Chichen-Itza,
because he had spoken ill of him, and in the 10th year of the last Ahau,
the seven chiefs of Hunac-eel overcame the governor Chacxibchac. If
a correction is to be made it should then stand 13th, 11th, 9th and 7th
Ahau, or the years 1176, 1200, 1224 and 1248 to the year 1272 A.&nbsp;D. Hence
it was the year 1258, the tenth year of the 7th Ahau that Chacxibchac
was overcome.</p>

<p class='c020'>During the 8th Ahau occurred the destruction of the power of King
Ulmil, because he had waged war against Ulil of Izamal, and Hunac-eel
at the head of 13 divisions overcame Ulmil in the 6th Ahau. [We are
unable to give the correction of Señor Perez, as we do not comprehend
his text.]</p>

<p class='c020'>§10. <em>In the 6th Ahau, 4th Ahau, 2d Ahau, 13th Ahau,

eighty-three years elapsed after this event, and at the beginning

<p class='c013'>In section 10 the 6th Ahau follows the 8th correctly, and
the 4th, 2d, 13th and 11th Ahaues were passed in internal
wars between Chichen-Itza and Mayalpan. In the 11th
Ahau a highland people, called Uitze (probably Quiché),
unite with the rulers of Chichen-Itza, and they then succeed
in destroying Mayalpan. In section 11 another destruction
of Mayalpan is reported. As this section begins with the
8th Ahau, and the foregoing ended with the 11th, a gap was
left which represents the (9th), (7th), (5th), (3d), (1st), (12th)
and (10th) Ahau. This gap undoubtedly means a period of
great exhaustion to both contending parties, and as a second
destruction of Mayalpan is reported in the 8th Ahau, we
may fairly assume that this city had recovered, and in making
a last effort to regain supremacy, was finally conquered. We
understand the two reported destructions of this city as the
heroic and victorious effort of the Maya race to exterminate
the foreign Nahuatl invader, who, for a long period succeeded
in taking a strong foothold in the country. In the
succeeding epochs of the 6th, 4th and 2d Ahau, exhaustion
from the war and disintegration must have ensued, for such
was the condition in which the Spaniards found the Maya
people in the following 13th and 11th Ahaues, which were
the last they were allowed to count.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Commentary of Señor Perez to Sections 10 and 11.</span>—In the
6th, 4th, 2d and 11th Ahaues the fortified land of Mayapan is attacked
by the men of Itza and their king Ulmil, for it had walls, and the people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>were governed in a community. The place was destroyed by foreigners
from the Highlands in the 11th Ahau, and Tancaj of Mayapan was also
conquered. The correction of the reckoning gives us the 5th, 3d, 1st,
12th and 10th Ahau. We have stated that the 5th <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Ahau</span></i> began in the
year 1272, and the others were consequently 1296, 1320, 1344, and 1368,
and the 8th Ahau ended in the year 1392 A.&nbsp;D.</p>

<p class='c020'>In the 8th Ahau Mayapan was destroyed, then followed the Katunes
of the 6th, 4th and 2d Ahau, in which latter the Spaniards passed by
and gave to the province the name of Yucatan. Hence, the Ahaues
begin again their regular course, though it is a contradiction to say in
the foregoing section that Mayapan had been destroyed in the 11th
Ahau (corrected to the 10th <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Ahau</span></i>). It would perhaps have been better
to say it had been destroyed for the second time, possibly for the purpose
of rebuilding it. The 8th Ahau began in the year 1392, the 6th,
4th and 2d Ahaues fell in the years 1416, 1440 and 1464, which last ended
in the year 1488 A.&nbsp;D.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Commentary of Señor Perez to Sections 12 and 13.</span>—In the 13th
and the 11th Ahaues pestilence and small-pox reigned. In the sixth
year, before the expiration of the 13th <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Ahau</span></i>, Ajpulà died at the time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>when four Katunes were counted on the east of the wheel. His death
happened on the 18th day of the month <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Zip</span></i>, on the 9th day Imix. This
date is wrong according to my reckoning; for the year 4 <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Cavac</span></i> expired
at the beginning and not at the end of the epoch, otherwise it would
have been the year 4 <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Muluc</span></i>. In the first case, the year 4 Cavac was that
of 1496, in the other case it would be the year 1506, and never that of
1536, for in that year the 9th Ahau began.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c014'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>We give, besides, a recapitulation which Señor Perez himself
added to his commentary, and for which we are indebted
to the kindness of the late Dr. C. Hermann Berendt:—</p>

<p class='c020'>“From what we have stated it will be seen that by only taking into
account the number of epochs which are mentioned in the manuscript,
and which elapsed between events, and by restoring this nomenclature
according to the progressive series of the Ahaues, it appears that all
indicated facts occur within the space of 58 epochs of 24 years
each, which makes in all 1392 years to the expiration of the 11th Ahau.
If we subtract these years from the year 1536, in which the 11th Ahau
expired, 1444 A.&nbsp;D. remains as the year when the Toltecs seem to have
arrived to colonize the country.</p>

<p class='c020'>But if we allow the epochs and their enumeration to stand as they
are, and in order to integrate the Ahaues in the sequence above indicated,
add those which are missing, we should find that 97 epochs,
each of 24 years had passed. The sum of 2328 years, represented by
this count, is a space of time of too great magnitude to bring into harmony
with Mexican history, and would signify that this country was 40
years older than the foundation of Rome, and 17 years older than the
introduction of Greek Olympiads, which is very improbable.</p>

<p class='c020'>Should any hypercritical person fail to believe in the list of epochs
because their succession is incorrect, let him remember that the list has
much to render it worthy of belief, though it must be subjected to corrections.
Still less ought any one to refuse belief in the historical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>statement of events. The manuscript indicates a traditional origin
common to the history of all primitive nations. It is noticeable that no
traditions exist to contradict the manuscript, and that it is the only one
thus far discovered. The contents of the manuscript might be thus
epitomized:—</p>

<p class='c020'>1. The Toltecs occupied 4 epochs in going from their home to Chacnouitan.</p>

<p class='c020'>8. Three other epochs pass, and in the 10th year of the following

<p class='c020'>9. In the same epoch of the defeat of the ruler of Chichen they
marched against Ulmil, who was king in the same Chichen, because he
had waged war against Ulil, king of Izamal, which war Hunac-eel,
brought to a close in the following epoch.</p>

</div>

<p class='c020'>10. In spite of Ulmil’s defeat this ruler of Chichen planned an invasion
of Mayapan. After the lapse of 2 more epochs, and in the third
year of that which followed, Mayapan was destroyed in the year 1368
by strangers who came from the mountains.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><span class='sc'>Concluding Remarks.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>It will be noticed from the text of the Manuscript, that
no events are commemorated but such as are connected with
<em>war</em>. In this style also the Nahuatl annals were drawn up.
With both nations <em>war</em> was recognized as the only fact
worthy to be kept in the memory of the coming generations.
Nor does the author state whether the country was ruled by
kings or an emperor. It is rather suggested (section 7) that
the tribes were gathered in groups, with a large town as a
centre, and this town was governed by a priest. The words
<i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">halach uinicil</span></i>, <em>holy men</em>, were somewhat too freely interpreted
with <em>governor</em> by the translator. In regard to the
considerable gaps in the sequence of years in the manuscript,
we will not longer attribute them to a lack of memory on
the part of the author, but to the custom generally observed
among the annalists to be regardless of any work of peace
performed by the nation; and whenever the question shall
be discussed, at what epoch the building of the huge pyramids
and temples took place, these dates will contribute to
the answer. Periods of peace certainly began with years of
great exhaustion; but recovery must have ensued, and the
unshaken energy of the people and their leaders must have
been directed to the undertaking of works, in which they
could exhibit also their taste for pomp and architectural
achievements. The gaps, therefore, instead of casting a
shadow upon the authority and completeness of the manuscript,
may rather be thought to perform the silent office of
throwing light into the obscure past of the Maya history.
As to the method, however, which we employed in computing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>the omitted periods of Ahaues, we have only to say that it
grew out from the nature of the Maya enumeration itself.
The two ends of the interrupted series being given, the
number of the intervening Ahaues could be easily supplied.</p>

<p class='c013'>What now remains is, to discover for the restored and completed
series of Ahaues the corresponding chronological
expressions in our era. We find the total Ahau periods
mentioned in the annals were 50. We have thought it necessary
to complete twenty more periods, so that we have
seventy periods (20×70), or 1400 years. As soon
therefore as we know in which year of our era the last
or 13th Ahau mentioned in the manuscript fell, we can,
by reckoning backward, find the years date of the first
Ahau mentioned, to wit: the 8th Ahau, and also determine
the dates and events of each of all the other intervening
Ahaues. The manuscript fortunately affords us the necessary
material for determining with incontestable certainty the
years date of the last 13th Ahau. It is the following: we
read in the 12th section that Chief Ajpulà died in a year
when there were still six years wanting before the expiration
of the 13th Ahau, and that the year of his decease was
1536 A.&nbsp;D.</p>

<p class='c013'>According to this statement the 13th Ahau ended with
the year 1542. Bishop Landa (see §41 of his <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Relacion de
las Cosas de Yucatan</span>) confirms the correctness of the above
calculation, though he says that the 13th Ahau expired with
the year 1541. Landa undoubtedly selects this date of
June 10th, 1541, as that of the last decisive victory at T’ho
over the Indians, while the author of the manuscript may
have had in mind the date when Mérida was officially incorporated
as the capital, and a dependency of the Spanish
crown, which was January 6, 1542.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c014'><sup>[46]</sup></a> If we subtract the
total number of Ahaues already obtained, and amounting to
1400 years, from the year 1542, we obtain for the first epoch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>named in the manuscript which is the 8th Ahau, or the
starting of the conquerors from Tulapan, the years 142–162
of our modern Christian era.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of all the dates calculated from the manuscript only that
of 1542 is well established from a historical point of view,
as that when Mérida was declared the future capital of the
conquered country. It is represented by the last year of
the 13th Ahau. A second date and event, that of the final
destruction of Mayapan, is mentioned by Cogolludo, who
places it about the year 1420 A.&nbsp;D., which would give (see
table, page <a href='#Page_96'>96</a>) a 12th or a 10th <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Ahau</span></i> period. But the
manuscript in §11 gives <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Vaxac Ahau</span></i>, or the 8th <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Ahau</span></i>, which
according to our computation represents the years between
1442 and 1462. Landa agrees with this statement (<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Relacion
de las Cosas de Yucatan, §IX., page 52</span>). “<em>It is now 120
years since Mayapan was destroyed.</em>” Landa wrote in the
year 1566, therefore, in his conception Mayapan was destroyed
in 1446, which year falls correctly in the 8th <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Ahau</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Landa’s account agrees also with another event mentioned
in the manuscript, the wanderings of the Itzaes 40 years in
the wilderness before they settled down at Uxmal and Mayapan,
in the 6th and 4th Ahau, which is in our calculation
from 942–982 A.&nbsp;D. Landa, however, does not fix the
year (<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Relacion de las Cosas de Yucatan, §VIII., page 46</span>).
In §VIII., page 49, he likewise speaks of a king of the
tribes of Cocomes, hostile to the Itzaes, who kept a Mexican
garrison in Mayapan. This is an allusion to the seven
Mayalpanes<a id='t94'></a> mentioned in the manuscript (in §8), all of whom
have Mexican (Nahuatl) names. There also the year is
not given. However, his confirmation of so early events in
Maya history appears to be of high value.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is fortunate that the manuscript just in the middle of
its narration exhibits a long succession of Ahau periods
without any gaps at all. We can count through sections 5,
6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, thirty-one <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Ahau</span></i> periods or 620 <em>years</em>
of uninterrupted history. They represent, according to our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>calculation, the epochs from the years 682–1302 A.&nbsp;D., or
from the taking of Champoton to the first destruction of
Mayapan by the assistance of the foreign Uitzes. This compact
period of time touches a very remote epoch in the history
of the civilized nations of Central America. It reaches
backwards to an epoch when in Europe, Pepin D’Heristal
and his family laid the foundation to their future ascendancy
on the throne of France. If we look still further backward
in our table, we notice another long period of time (sections
3 and 4) which represents the sum of eight uninterrupted
Ahaues, equal to 160 years. The connection of these two
great periods was re-established by the interpolation of the
three Ahaues, 8, 10 and 12 in section 5, a correction for
which there should be not the least question. Groping our
way, we should reach the epochs when Bacalar was founded,
with a date as early as between 462 and 482 A.&nbsp;D. At
this point we are no longer able to follow the conquerors on
their route. The location of Bacalar is well known to us,
but that of Chacnouitan and Tulapan has escaped our investigation.
Notwithstanding, by the aid of the quoted Ahaues
we are able to fix the time for the long rest and residence in
Chacnouitan, and for their remote starting from Tulapan.
It comprises the epochs backwards from the year 462 to that
of 162, and since the text reports that eighty years were
spent in the migration, we are entitled to fix the time for
the arrival in the peninsula with the year 242 A.&nbsp;D. It is
of significance for our purpose, that this settling on the
peninsula can be computed with the year 242 A.&nbsp;D. It represents,
as will be seen, the 13th Ahau, a date always assumed by
the Maya chronologists as one with which they designate the
commencement of a new cycle.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>The following table contains a chronological translation of the Ahaues as
they correspond with the years of our Christian era. Accordingly, the historical
events would correspond to the following dates of our Christian era:—</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>It will be noticed that the result obtained by our computation
is almost identical with that of Señor Perez. In his
conception the manuscript comprises the epoch from 144–1536
A.&nbsp;D.; in ours, that from 142–1542. A coincidence
like this may be thought to justify the conclusion that although
we differed in our methods of interpretation and
reckoning, the agreement of the results appears so much the
more satisfactory. We should be pleased to view the
subject in so favorable a light, but fear we cannot. For,
whilst, on the one hand, we are far from claiming any infallibility
for our <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus procedendi</span></i>, on the other hand, we
cannot help protesting against Señor Perez’s methods of
obtaining his results. Besides giving to the Ahau the not
admissible duration of 24 years, he further makes an
evident mistake in the summing up of the Ahaues quoted in
the manuscript, by counting 58 of them instead of 50. He
does not seem aware that the Maya author mentions various
of these Ahaues twice, and even thrice, a fact which we
took care to point out in the course of our discussion. It
is only by increasing the length of the Ahau to 24 years,
and also by counting 8 Ahaues more than there actually
were, that Señor Perez is able to arrive at the date of 144
A.&nbsp;D. for the exodus from Tulapan. If we should indeed incline
to make allowance for his choice of the 24–year period,
because as it seems to us he was misled by his authorities, he
notwithstanding must be held accountable for the mistake
made in <em>counting in</em> those eight ill-starred Ahaues. His
computation therefore being defective in itself, the favorable
impression gained from the fact that two interpreters arrived
at an almost identical result, will disappear. Such an agreement
would have been very valuable if either of the two
interpreters could show that his method stands the test of incontrovertible
proof. Therefore, it is only by chance that
Señor Perez’s mistakes in reckoning make up very nearly
the same number of years that we have obtained; first, by
means of the interpolation of 20 more Ahaues; and second,
by allowing only 20 years for each Ahau period.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>In conclusion it may be proper to make some statements
as to the position which this manuscript holds in aboriginal
literature, and also as to its value and use as a chronological
document. In the first place we are fully convinced of
its genuineness. We have not been able to examine the
document itself as to the material upon which it was written,
nor as to the characters of the text, nor as to external appearance,
and we are not informed into whose hands it fell
after it left those of its author before it came into the possession
of Señor Perez. But we believe that Señor Perez
had good reasons for regarding it as a document prepared
in the last half of the 16th century, at a time near to that
when Yucatan was conquered by the Spaniards. The language
and construction belong to that epoch, as we are told.
But even if it should not be an original, but a second or
third copy, this would not be enough to shake our faith in
the authenticity and importance of its contents. For setting
aside the fact that its matter has a specific national
character, and presupposes a knowledge on the part of its
author which only a native could have obtained, the style of
its composition indicates its national bearing.</p>

<p class='c013'>Let us fancy ourselves in the position of the Maya writer
while at work. Before him, on the table, stands the wheel
for counting the Ahaues, and as he bends over the sheets
containing the painted annals, his eye turns alternately from
the paper to the wheel, making a careful comparison. Then
he pauses and considers in his mind what expressions he must
use, and afterwards begins to write. From time to time
he cannot forbear, however, casting an occasional glance at
the letters of the Spanish alphabet, in order to shape them
correctly, for he is still a beginner in this new art. Now,
perhaps he wavers for a moment, and then begins anew.
The recollection of some ancient Maya song steals in upon
his mind, and by the aid of a few significant sentences he
incorporates the substance with his text. To interpolations
of this kind we may attribute such phrases as “the disrespectful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>utterances of Chacxibchac against Hunac-eel.” Of
the ancient Maya ballads, it is to be regretted, none are
known to exist. Yet there is no reason for relinquishing the
hope altogether, that some day, at least, a copy of the painted
annals, which our Maya writer evidently consulted, may be
discovered, while we can willingly dispense with the ballads.</p>

<p class='c013'>As long as such hopes fail of realization, we must be satisfied
with the slight, but yet important, contribution offered
us in the manuscript. We may complain of its brevity, yet
notwithstanding it is the most complete document we possess
of ancient American history. It is all the more important
for the reason that it relates to Yucatan, which in our opinion,
is the <em>very cradle</em> of early American civilization. It is
also pleasant to observe that the manuscript is not at variance
with what we have learned from the fragmentary
records made by Landa, Lizana and Cogolludo. Notwithstanding
its imperfections, it interprets and explains much that
had hitherto appeared uncertain and deficient. It is of undoubted
authenticity, and forms a firm foundation for the
reconstruction of the history of the past, which till now has
remained enigmatical, and which is faintly expressed by the
crumbling ruins of the peninsula.</p>

<p class='c013'>The manuscript, finally, affords a guarantee that the long
past not only reached back to the remotest epoch of our
era, but that more than all, it stands in a near, perhaps in
the most intimate, connection with the history of the Nahuatl
race. In reference to the homogeneous structure of the
Maya and Nahuatl calendars we have already expressed our
belief that these two nations were closely related to each other.
In the traditions of both occurs the name of Tula or Tulapan,
as a fatherland common to each of them.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c014'><sup>[47]</sup></a> This supposition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>appears to us still further justified by the circumstance that
the chronological annals of both nations revert to the same
period of time as a starting point. As regards the Nahuatls,
we refer to the circle of signs engraved on the Calendar
Stone which gave us the information that the annalists of
Anahuac in the year 1479, counted back twelve hundred
and forty-eight years to the celebration of their first festival
in honor of the sun; that is, they carried back their political
or religious record to the year 231 A.&nbsp;D. The Maya manuscript
corresponds to this date, as we think, since the year
242 A.&nbsp;D. resulted from our calculation. It was the year
in which the ancient conquerors, after wandering 80 years,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>arrived on the Island of Chacnouitan where they made a
permanent settlement. This event happened in the 13th
Ahau (see table), which, as we know, is the starting point of
Maya chronology, and likewise the first date of that name
which the manuscript mentions. The difference of 11 years
which appears in the Nahuatl computation cannot be regarded
as of much importance.</p>

<p class='c013'>If, however, it should seem desirable to examine chronological
parallels we shall refer our readers to a second chapter
on Central American chronology which is hereafter to
appear, in which we propose to undertake the task of illustrating
and explaining still further the parallelism of Maya
and Nahuatl dates. It will then be proved that in this
written and still existing Nahuatl chronology, supported by
the date 231 A.&nbsp;D., found on the Calendar Stone, a still
earlier date designated as <i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">X Calli</span></i> can be found, which represents
the year 137 A.&nbsp;D. In this year, according to the
annals, a great eclipse of the sun took place, with the remarkable
statement that it occurred exactly at the end of a
year at 12 o’clock noon. In our manuscript we find the
first date preceding the settlement of Chacnouitan designated
with the 8th Ahau, the date of the setting out from Tulapan,
which we have already stated to be the years 142–162
A.&nbsp;D. Another agreement is that the Nahuatl records show
that 166 years before the occurrence of the above mentioned
eclipse of the sun in the year 1 <i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">Tecpatl</span></i>, a congress of astrologers
to amend the calendar of the nation took place at a
town called Huehuetlapallan, and by reckoning back we find
that this year corresponds with the year 29 B.&nbsp;C. If we then
follow a hint which Señor Perez has very ingeniously furnished
that the manuscript strangely begins with an 8th
Ahau instead of a 13th Ahau, and that the Maya chronology
could be dated back to such a 13th Ahau as a proper beginning
connected with some interesting event, we find by
reckoning back from the 8th to the 13th Ahau the corresponding
date to be the years 18–38 B.&nbsp;C.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>Now, the results gained in this line of investigation, can
be formulated as follows:—</p>

<p class='c013'>1. That the conquerors and settlers of the Yucatan peninsula,
as well as those of the Anahuac lakes, were joint participants
in a correction of their national calendar about the
year 29 B.&nbsp;C.</p>

<p class='c013'>2. That about the year 137 A.&nbsp;D., when a total eclipse of
the sun took place, the ancestors of both nations set out
from their common fatherland, Tula or Tulapan.</p>

<p class='c013'>3. That about the year 231 A.&nbsp;D., both nations made
their appearance on the coast of Central America, and succeeded
in conquering a large portion of the peninsula.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is true that we have only documentary evidence to substantiate
the theory just referred to. But, if we do not possess
the desirable evidence of monumental inscriptions, it
behooves us to examine and to weigh carefully that which
still remains. In this connection we should also remember
that the sculptor, in carving his records, was not guided
by his memory alone, but that he copied the symbols from
the sacred books of his race; and that on the other hand,
our learned Maya writer, when translating these latter into
written phonetic language, drew his text, as did the sculptor
from similar sources.</p>

<p class='c013'>If therefore with the help of written records we can build
up hypotheses partially satisfactory, and not altogether improbable,
we have accomplished all that could be expected
for the present, at least, and have perhaps excited an interest
in a branch of history which has hitherto been held as
dead and unproductive.</p>

<p class='c013'>In conclusion, we would express the hope that the Maya
manuscript may be submitted to a rigid critical and linguistic
examination, and that the publication of the work may be
appended to a heliotype copy of the original in order to exhibit
to students a document of so great importance, and to

España, Madrid, 1632, I. Vol., Cap. 92, “y vendian hachas de laton, y
cobre y estaño.”</span> The meaning of this passage is, beyond all misinterpretation:
He saw for sale bronze axes, and besides pieces of copper and
others of tin. The order, in which these three words stand, conveys a
suggestion that we should not wholly ignore. The word <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">laton</span></i> (bronze)
is followed by <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">cobre</span></i> (copper) and <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">estano</span></i> (tin), the two well known components
of bronze. Might not the relative position of the three words
teach that, to them, bronze was the most important metal and was therefore
assigned the first place, mentioning the copper and tin afterwards as
the elements from which the bronze was made? We might also go
farther and inquire how the first metal came to be recognized by them as
bronze. In framing a reply, let us consider three possible explanations. Let
us suppose, first, that they knew the bronze well enough to recognize it
at once. They, further, may have entertained doubts as to its identity,
but finally have been led to this conclusion by seeing the copper and tin
exhibited in the stalls, together with the bronze. Thirdly, we may also
suppose, that they would desire to obtain more positive confirmation
and therefore have inquired and learned from their native guides that
this bronze was actually a composition of the two other metals before
them. Therefore, considering all these cases, when engaged in composing
their narration, the Spaniards would have remembered the
circumstances connected with the memorable visit to the market, and
have enumerated the metals in the order in which they actually are
found; first, the bronze, the main object of their curiosity, and then the
copper and tin as the key to the puzzle.</p>

<p class='c013'>We, however, make no defence of this forced and artificial interpretation
of the language, and still less would in this manner build a premise
from which to deduce the final conclusion, that the natives make bronze
from copper and tin. On the contrary, the facts elicited from our material,
as will be seen later, conduct us to very different conclusions.
Still, having been struck by the occurrence of the three words and their
relative positions, we could not dismiss them altogether, especially as
Cortes and Bernal Diaz were eye-witnesses and were, therefore, of highest
authority. Besides, it is by no means impossible that in the future,
instruments of bronze may actually be discovered and found to be composed
of tin and copper. In such an event our judgment would favor
the opinion that Cortes and his followers were keener observers and investigators
than those who during three and one-half centuries have attempted
to ventilate the question.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the same position of words, compare also <em>Gomara</em> (<em>Francisco Lopez
de</em>), <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Historia General de las Indias, Ed. Barcia, Cap. 79</span>: “There is also
much featherwork in the market, and gold, silver, copper, lead, bronze
(<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">laton</span></i>) and tin, though these three latter metals are scarce.” Gomara,
it will be noticed, changed somewhat the position of the words, as compilers
often do. He was a secretary to Cortes, and his work appeared
in Zaragoza, 1552–1553, five years after Cortes’ death.</p>

of gold there was also allowed an eighth of alloy to every ounce to
assist the men in the purchase of the necessaries of life. But we (the
soldiers) derived no advantage from this, but on the contrary, it proved
very prejudicial to us, for the merchants added the same percentage to
the price of their goods and sold for five pesos what was only worth
three, and so this alloy became, as the Indians term it, tepuzque or copper.
This expression became so common among us, that we added it to
the names of the distinguished cavaliers to express the worth of their
character, as, for instance, we used to say, Señor Don Juan of so much
tepuzque.”</p>

copper mines by the indigenous people of these provinces is mentioned:
“There are very abundant copper mines in this district, more towards

for tilling the ground, instead of using iron, for they were not
acquainted with iron before the Spaniards entered the kingdom.” As
will be seen later, there is no doubt as to the latter assertion. But we
fear the former to be an anachronism and the manufacturing of <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">vasos de

<div class='footnote' id='f13'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r13'>13</a>. This little figure symbolizing gold, recurs only once more in all those
Mexican paintings which we have been able to examine. It stands in
Vol. I., Kingsb. Collection, Cod. Mendoza, page 13, fig. 4, and is identical
with that represented by the engraving. We do not venture too far in
asserting that the symbol on this gold piece represents a genuine Mexican
numeral. It is composed of a cross, having a dot in each of its
quadrants. This cross is the well known symbol of the number 8000
(<i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">xiquipilli</span></i>), and each dot stands for the number 1. We have thus expressed
four times 8000 (<span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">nahui xiquipilli</span>) or 32,000. Here, however, the
interpretation ends, so far as it may be based upon accepted authorities.
Whatever else there is to be learned concerning this number 32,000,
found on the gold piece, must be derived by the confessedly hazardous
process of induction.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nevertheless, let us try this process and ascertain what the number
32,000 actually refers to. In answering this question it may, perhaps,
fairly be assumed that the number stands in a direct relation to a certain
numerical unity, like that in which hundreds stand to the tens, 100:1.
Such a numerical unity, however, presupposes the existence of some
tangible equivalent, which in Mexican commerce, if it was not some
small piece of metal, would have had some other conventional representation,
either in merchandise or in labor. If such a unity actually existed
it is clear that its value must have been fixed either by weight or
by measure. There is, however, no positive proof that such a unity, fixed
by weight or measure, ever existed among the Mexicans. Cortes, in the
above quoted letter, pretends that it was impossible for him to detect the
use of any weights or scales, and no writer after him has touched this question
or given any other decision. Respecting measures, there is no direct
testimony at all. But, on the other hand, it is hardly to be imagined
that these people, of whose religious administration and social polity we
have such abundant evidences, should have been deficient to such an extent
in the department of their commercial polity as not to have found
any method by which the proportion between the value of the precious
metal to merchandise in all its forms was to be expressed. We must
guard ourselves against the fallacy that because we are not acquainted
with the method it could not have existed. There are grounds to
believe that Cortes was right in saying that the Mexicans did not know
the use of weights (their vocabulary does not show any word answering
to <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">peso, pesilla, libra, balanza romana</span>), but, we think they knew perfectly
the use of measures (the vocabulary gives about twenty words for
all varieties of this operation); and in regard to a certain unity of measure
employed in gold transactions, there are indications given by other
trustworthy writers that this unity might be detected in the quills, of
conventional length, and probably of conventional diameter, which
quills were filled up with grains of gold dust, by the color and shades
of which they graduated the respective value. Bernal Diaz, Chapter
92: <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Antes de salir de la misma plaza, estaban otros muchos mercaderes,
que, segun dixeron, era que tenian a <em>vender oro en granos</em> como lo sacan
de las minas, metido el oro en unos <em>canutillos</em> delgados de los anserones
de tierra (<span lang="en" xml:lang="en">thin goose quills</span>) e asi blancos porque se pareciese el oro por
defuera, y por el <em>largor y gordor</em> de los canutillos (<span lang="en" xml:lang="en">length and width of
the quills</span>) tenian entre ellos su cuenta (<span lang="en" xml:lang="en">they made up their account</span>)
que tantas mantas o que xiquipiles de cacao salia o qualquier otra cosa
a que lo trocavan.</span></p>

<p class='c013'>This point being settled let us next introduce one other, for it will
contribute to strengthen the probability that besides the quill there existed
still a lower unity, that of the grain of gold itself, by which they
counted. For this purpose, let us turn again to the gold piece represented
in the painting. It is round. This reminds us of what was told
by Cortes of the little pieces of <em>tin</em> discovered in Tachco, which, he said,
were used as coins. Likewise, we read in Bernal Diaz that Motezuma
used to pay with pieces of gold when he lost in playing <i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">patol</span></i> (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trictrac</span>)
with his Spanish jailors. The word employed by the author and eye-witness
of the game, is “<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">tejuelo</span></i>,” which, according to Spanish usages and
the dictionaries of their language, signifies: a round piece of metal.
The author moreover informs us of the value of this tejuelo. It was 50
ducats of weight and must, therefore, have been equivalent to, at least,
one hundred dollars of gold. Since Bernal Diaz in this entire passage
wishes to express his highest esteem for Motezuma on account of the
princely generosity with which he paid even those whom he knew had
cheated him, we may fairly conclude that these <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">tejuelos</span> were not the
lowest, but rather the highest, gold pieces that he had at his disposal.
Should we now remember the number, 32,000, which is the highest found
represented in Mexican pictures (they generally never exceed that of
8000, the <i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">xiquipilli</span></i>), it is not at all improbable that the Motezuma-tejuelo,
about 100 dollars worth, might have been equivalent to 32,000 unities,
while this unity may have been one grain of gold.  For if we would
divide 100 dollars of gold into 32,000 equal parts, or still farther divide
one gold dollar into 320 equal parts, each part would represent a very
small portion of gold, but still large enough to be counted separately
with the finger. This was the way the gold-dust was collected on the
placeres, not by men but by women and children. The procedure was
primitive, indeed, in the highest degree. In such a way, however, gold
gathering was undoubtedly practised in the first stage of men’s civilization.
If not written in history, yet the linguistical testimony bears witness
to it. We find the expression “<em>grain of gold</em>” to be the common
property among the ancient and modern nations in connection with commerce
and the weighing of gold.</p>

one, they make a flat cup or a plate.” (<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Pero con una piedra sobre
otra hacian una taza llana y un plato.</span>) <em>Gomara, l. c.</em> “They will cast a

that is to say, the one of gold, the other of silver, without any kind of
solder. They will also cast a little caldron with loose handles hanging
thereto, as we used to cast a bell. They will also cast in a mould a fish
with one scale of silver on its back and another of gold; they will make
a parrot of metal so that his tongue shall shake and his head move and
his wings flutter; they will cast an ape in a mould so that both hands and
feet will stir, and holding a spindle in his hand, seeming to spin, yea,
and an apple in his hand, as if he would eat it. Our Spaniards were not
a little amazed at the sight of these things, for our goldsmiths are not

the sculptors and the gold and silversmiths, who were clever in
working and smelting gold, and would have astonished the most celebrated
of our Spanish goldsmiths; the number of these were very great

leagues from Mexico.” <em>Petrus Martyr, Decade VI., Chapter 6</em>. (A letter
written to Pope Adrian VI.) “The chief noblemen’s houses (in Nicaragua)
compass and inclose the King’s street on every side; in the
middle site whereof one is erected, in which the goldsmiths dwell. Gold
is there molten and forged (?) to be formed into divers jewels, and is
formed into small plates or bars, to be stamped after the pleasure of its
owners and at length is brought into the form and fashion they desire,
and that neatly too.”</p>

flocked along the ways, astonished to see the beards and the dressing of

cacique, who came attended by five hundred men and seventeen women,
covered with gold plates, all drawn up in order, but without arms and
with ten banners and trumpets, after their fashion. When they came
near, the banners were displayed and the cacique touched Gonzales’
hand, as did all the five hundred, everyone giving him a turkey. Yet

They represent views of the volcano of Masaya, gymnastic sports of the
Indians, a plan of the town of Tecoatega, and three Indian arms, an

<p class='c013'><a href='#r23'>23</a>. With our first glance at the picture of <i><span lang="nci-latn" xml:lang="nci-latn">Tepozcolula</span></i> we were induced
to believe that we had found therein a representation of the instrument
which Petrus Martyr called a “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dolabra</span></i>,” and Sahagun “<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">azuela</span></i>.” The
translation of the one is, pick or hoe, and of the other, cooper’s adze.
Both of these, therefore, would have been instruments in which the blade
and its edge are at right angles to their handle, and the management of
which requires both hands of the workman. This supposition is refuted
by the picture of the carpenter (cut <a href='#cut_10'>10</a>), who is distinctly seen to hold
the piece of wood in the left and the tool in his right hand.</p>

is in accordance, in many details, with that of the anonymous author
of the ‘Maya Epochs.’”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f34'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r34'>34</a>. <em>Diego Lopez de Cogolludo</em>, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Historia de Yuacathan. Madrid, 1683,
Lib. IV., Cap. 5</span>. “The count they kept in their books was by 20 to
20 years, and also by <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">lustros</span></i> of 4 to 4 years. When five of these lustros
had passed, or twenty years elapsed, they called this time <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Katun</span></i>, and
set one hewn stone (<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">piedra labrada</span></i>) upon another, well cemented by
lime and sand. This can be noticed in their temples and ecclesiastical
buildings, and especially on some ancient walls of our convent in
Mérida, upon which the cells have been built.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The expression Katun, mentioned in this passage, and to which we
have assigned a place in our title, requires a few words of explanation.
As far as we know, it occurs only three times in our Central American
authors; in Cogolludo, Landa, and in our manuscript. The first gives
Katun the meaning of a period of twenty years. The second (§ XLI.),
uses the following phraseology: “<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Contando XIII. veyntes con una de
las XX. letras de los meses que llaman Ahau, sin orden, sino retruecandolos
como pareceran en las siguiente raya redonda, llaman les a estos
en su lengua Katunes.</span>” This phraseology is somewhat obscure, nevertheless
it will be admitted that his intention was to state that each of
the images of the thirteen Ahaues, depicted on the surface of the wheel,
represented twenty years, this being a period which they also called
Katunes. We arrive at this definite conclusion by the consideration
that if Landa says that the period of twenty years was called <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Ahau</span></i>, and
another one, that of 260 years, <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Katun</span></i>, he would have stated the latter
fact in expressive words; the occasion for doing so being too urgent to
let it pass. The third author uses the word <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Katun</span></i> in his introductory
lines, without giving it any numerical value. But it will be noticed
that in the text which follows, the expression <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Katun</span></i> is used interchangeably
with that of Ahau for a period of 20 years. This concordance
of the three authors allows us to conclude that whenever the word
<i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Katun</span></i> is employed, the short period of 20 years was meant. In this
connection a question arises: How is it that no author has made mention
of the long period of 260 years, with which we become acquainted
in Señor Perez’s chronological essay. It is probable he found it mentioned
in some Maya manuscripts in which this long period appeared
under the name of <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Ahau Katun</span></i>. Though this fact of itself may be considered
of no importance, still, as it would bring to light another of the
many numerical combinations (13×20=260) in which those people indulged,
with the fundamental figures of their calendar system, we
must feel a great interest in the asserted fact, hoping it will turn
out to be a correct statement. Our researches have been directed for a
long time towards the discovery of the symbols which the Maya annalists
or sculptors would have employed for their chronological periods.
It was in connection with these studies that we discovered the
Nahuatl symbols for the same, of which we gave account in our discussion
on the Calendar Stone. Yet while this discovery only corroborates the
suspicion long entertained that a certain set of Maya symbols represented
the lustra of 5, and another the period of 20 years, we have
not yet been able to recognize a Maya symbol for the period of 260
years.</p>

<p class='c013'>The word Katun is a compound of <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Kat</span></i>, to ask, to consult, and <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">tun</span></i>,
stone; hence the stone, which when asked, gives account. Thus it was
also understood by Cogolludo, who, when mentioning the word <i><span lang="yua-latn" xml:lang="yua-latn">Katun</span></i>
(see above), was referring to the square stones incrusted into walls,
upon which the convent was built. What traditions he followed in this
is still better illustrated by the words in continuation of this passage:
“In a place called Tixualahtun, which means a spot where one hewn
stone is set upon another one, the Archives of the Indians are said to
have existed, to which they resorted for all questions of historical
interest (<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">recurso de todos los acaecimientos</span>), as we should do to
Simancas, in Spain.” The stone columns found on the spot named,
can be seen pictured in J. L. Stephens’ Incidents of travel in Yucatan,
Vol. II., page 318.</p>

<p class='c013'><a href='#r37'>37</a>. A specimen of such an instrument with a surface inscribed as the
cut shows would hardly have been preserved. We think that the box enclosed
a round disk turning on a pivot; this contrivance, evidently
served as an aid to the memory in enumerating the alternating Ahaues.
To-day, we should obtain the same result by writing the Ahaues in a
horizontal or vertical line, but the Nahuatls and Mayas, having solely a
symbolical or pictorial manner of representation, made use of this ingenious
arrangement by painting the series of the Ahaues on the circumference
of a circle. Thus the idea of an uninterrupted sequence of time
and the connection of the 2d Ahau with the 13th were brought to notice.</p>

<em>comme partout ailleurs</em>, les Mexicains ont rangé les hiéroglyphes de droite
à gauche.</span>” The great scholar has clothed in the form of a proven statement
that which at the beginning of this century was an opinion generally
prevalent among Americanists, and which does not bear the test,
when the numerous copies existing of the Mexican calendar days are
examined. They all show the arrangement of the days from the left to
the right. The sculptured calendar is the only exception.</p>

and those of his own translation. This translation said correctly:
“There were still six years wanting before the completion of the 13th
Ahau.” In the text of the commentary, however, we find him starting
his count on the supposition that the original text was the sixth year of
the 13th Ahau. Though this change is by no means allowable, he succeeds,
ingeniously enough, in arriving at the year above quoted, and in
stating also the dates of the day and month, precisely as the annalist

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
